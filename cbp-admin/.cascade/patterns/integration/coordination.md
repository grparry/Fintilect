## Integration Guidelines
```yaml
coordination_principles:
  oversight:
    focus:
      - Pattern health
      - Service coordination
      - Resource efficiency
      - Compliance status
    
    priorities:
      - Critical patterns
      - Service alignment
      - Resource constraints
      - Security risks
    
    escalation:
      - Alert thresholds
      - Response times
      - Impact severity
      - Resolution paths

  management:
    responsibilities:
      - Pattern monitoring
      - Service oversight
      - Resource management
      - Compliance tracking
    
    communication:
      - Status updates
      - Service alerts
      - Resource notices
      - Compliance reports
    
    documentation:
      - Pattern records
      - Service logs
      - Resource data
      - Compliance files
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  pattern_isolation:
    description: "Isolated pattern management"
    instead: "Coordinated administration"
    reasons:
      - Reduces visibility
      - Increases complexity
      - Hampers coordination
      - Compromises control
    
  fragmented_oversight:
    description: "Disconnected monitoring"
    instead: "Unified oversight"
    reasons:
      - Splits responsibility
      - Reduces efficiency
      - Increases overhead
      - Complicates management
    
  inconsistent_compliance:
    description: "Varying compliance approaches"
    instead: "Standardized compliance"
    reasons:
      - Policy conflicts
      - Audit gaps
      - Control issues
      - Risk exposure
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
