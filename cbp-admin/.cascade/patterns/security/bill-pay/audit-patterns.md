      - Impact evaluation
      - Risk assessment
    
    reporting:
      - System reports
      - Error summaries
      - Performance analysis
```

## Compliance Management
```yaml
compliance_monitoring:
  pattern: "Compliance Audit"
  implementation:
    tracking:
      - Policy compliance
      - Rule enforcement
      - Exception handling
    
    analysis:
      - Compliance status
      - Risk evaluation
      - Impact assessment
    
    reporting:
      - Compliance reports
      - Violation summaries

regulatory_reporting:
  pattern: "Regulatory Audit"
  implementation:
    collection:
      - Data gathering
      - Format validation
      - Completeness checks
    
    processing:
      - Report generation
      - Review workflow
      - Approval tracking
    
    submission:
      - Report delivery
      - Status tracking
      - Record keeping
```

## Report Management
```yaml
report_admin:
  pattern: "Report Administration"
  implementation:
    configuration:
      - Report templates
      - Schedule rules
      - Distribution lists
    
    generation:
      - Data collection
      - Report creation
      - Format control
    
    distribution:
      - Report delivery
      - Access control
      - Archive management

archive_admin:

    configuration:
      - Retention rules
      - Storage policies
      - Access controls
    
    maintenance:
      - Data archival
      - Cleanup processes
      - Access tracking
    
    retrieval:
      - Search capability
      - Access control
      - Delivery options
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  incomplete_audit:
    why: "Missing data"
    instead: "Comprehensive tracking"
    
  manual_reports:
    why: "Inconsistency risk"
    instead: "Automated generation"
    
  unmanaged_storage:
    why: "Resource waste"
    instead: "Controlled retention"
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
approach:
  audit_tests:
    - Configuration control
    - Data collection
    - Report generation
    
  compliance_tests:
    - Policy validation
    - Rule enforcement
    - Report accuracy
    
  performance_tests:
    - Storage efficiency
    - Processing speed
    - Retrieval time
```

## Monitoring Guidelines
```yaml
observability:
  metrics:
    - Audit performance
    - Storage usage
    - Processing time
    
  logging:
    - Configuration changes
    - Processing events
    - Access patterns
    
  alerting:
    - Storage issues
    - Processing problems
    - Access violations
```
