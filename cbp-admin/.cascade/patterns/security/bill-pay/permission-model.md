# Bill Pay Permission Model

## Core Principles
```yaml
purpose: "Secure payment processing authorization"
key_aspects:
  - Role-based access
  - Amount-based limits
  - Operation restrictions
  - Audit requirements
```

## Permission Structure
```yaml
role_hierarchy:
  pattern: "Payment Operation Roles"
  roles:
    payment_processor:
      operations:
        - Submit payments
        - View status
        - Handle exceptions
      limits:
        - Amount thresholds
        - Schedule restrictions
        - Batch size
    
    payment_manager:
      operations:
        - Approve payments
        - Manage exceptions
        - Update limits
      limits:
        - Approval thresholds
        - Override capabilities
        - Batch management
    
    payment_admin:
      operations:
        - Configure system
        - Manage roles
        - View audit logs
      limits:
        - System configuration
        - Role management
        - Audit access

operation_matrix:
  pattern: "Operation Authorization"
  categories:
    submission:
      - Amount validation
      - Schedule verification
      - Account access
    
    management:
      - Status updates
      - Exception handling
      - Batch operations
    
    configuration:
      - Limit settings
      - Role assignments
      - System settings
```

## Security Boundaries
```yaml
amount_limits:
  pattern: "Threshold Control"
  implementation:
    validation:
      - Pre-submission checks
      - Role-based limits
      - Override rules
    
    enforcement:
      - Runtime validation
      - Approval workflows
      - Audit logging
    
    management:
      - Limit updates
      - Override tracking
      - History maintenance

batch_controls:
  pattern: "Batch Operation Security"
  implementation:
    validation:
      - Size limits
      - Total amount checks
      - Operation rules
    
    enforcement:
      - Progressive processing
      - Status tracking
      - Error isolation
    
    management:
      - Limit configuration
      - Override handling
      - Audit requirements
```

## Access Control
```yaml
operation_control:
  pattern: "Operation Authorization"
  checks:
    pre_operation:
      - Role validation
      - Amount verification
      - Schedule check
    
    during_operation:
      - State transitions
      - Update permissions
      - Error handling
    
    post_operation:
      - Result access
      - History viewing
      - Audit logging

override_management:
  pattern: "Secure Overrides"
  workflow:
    request:
      - Justification
      - Amount delta
      - Time sensitivity
    
    approval:
      - Manager review
      - Limit validation
      - Documentation
    
    execution:
      - Override tracking
      - Audit logging
      - Status updates
```

## Audit Integration
```yaml
audit_requirements:
  pattern: "Payment Audit Trail"
  tracking:
    operations:
      - Submission details
      - Status changes
      - Exception handling
    
    permissions:
      - Role changes
      - Limit updates
      - Override usage
    
    access:
      - View operations
      - Export activities
      - Report generation

retention_rules:
  pattern: "Audit Retention"
  implementation:
    storage:
      - Duration rules
      - Access control
      - Data protection
    
    retrieval:
      - Search capabilities
      - Export controls
      - Access logging
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  permission_caching:
    why: "Security bypass risk"
    instead: "Real-time validation"
    
  role_sharing:
    why: "Audit confusion"
    instead: "Individual assignments"
    
  limit_bypassing:
    why: "Control violation"
    instead: "Proper overrides"
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
approach:
  permission_tests:
    - Role enforcement
    - Limit validation
    - Override handling
    
  security_tests:
    - Access control
    - Audit logging
    - Data protection
    
  integration_tests:
    - Workflow security
    - State transitions
    - Error handling
```

## Migration Guidelines
```yaml
considerations:
  role_migration:
    - Map existing roles
    - Validate permissions
    - Update assignments
    
  limit_transition:
    - Convert thresholds
    - Update validations
    - Verify enforcement
    
  audit_alignment:
    - Update tracking
    - Verify logging
    - Confirm retention
```
