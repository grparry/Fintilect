# Navigation Pattern

## Purpose
Defines the structure and behavior of the application's navigation system, including route configuration, section management, and sidebar rendering.

## Components
- Route Configuration
  - Section-based organization
  - Path definitions
  - Component mapping
- Section Management
  - Section grouping
  - Access control integration
  - Visibility rules
- Sidebar Navigation
  - Dynamic rendering
  - Hierarchical display
  - Active state management

## Implementation Details
```typescript
interface RouteSection {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  basePath: string;
  routes: RouteConfig[];
}

interface RouteConfig {
  id: string;
  path: string;
  title: string;
  element: React.ComponentType;
  icon?: string;
  sectionId: string;
  hideFromSidebar?: boolean;
  children?: RouteConfig[];
}
```

## Validation Rules
1. Each route must have a unique ID within its section
2. Section IDs must match their configuration keys
3. Child routes inherit their parent's section ID
4. Hidden routes must still maintain proper relationships

## Security Considerations
- Section visibility based on user permissions
- Route access control integration
- Dynamic path parameter validation

## Relationships
- Depends on: 
  - Security Access Control
  - User Authentication
- Implements: 
  - UI/UX Standards
  - Route Management
- Extends: 
  - Base Routing
  - Component Layout

## Metrics
- Route resolution time
- Navigation state updates
- Section load performance
- Pattern execution success rate
