# Client Configuration Patterns

## Core Principles
```yaml
purpose: "Manage credit union client configuration"
key_aspects:
  - Configuration management
  - Administrative state
  - Audit requirements
```

## Configuration Management Pattern
```yaml
pattern: "Centralized Configuration"
rationale: |
  Maintain consistent and auditable configuration
  management for credit union clients.

configuration_boundaries:
  - Integration settings
  - Feature flags
  - Access controls
  - Administrative preferences

state_management:
  - Track configuration versions
  - Maintain change history
  - Record modification context
```

## Administrative State Pattern
```yaml
pattern: "Administrative State Tracking"
rationale: |
  Track and manage administrative state of credit union
  configurations and user access.

state_tracking:
  client_state:
    - Active/Inactive status
    - Last configuration update
    - Last administrative action
  
  user_state:
    - Access status
    - Permission updates
    - Administrative actions

audit_requirements:
  - Track all state changes
  - Record modification context
  - Maintain change history
```

## Configuration Validation Pattern
```yaml
pattern: "Configuration Validation"
rationale: |
  Ensure configuration integrity and prevent invalid states.

validation_requirements:
  - Integration endpoint validation
  - Feature flag consistency
  - Permission model integrity
  - Configuration dependencies

change_management:
  - Validate before apply
  - Track failed attempts
  - Maintain audit trail
```
