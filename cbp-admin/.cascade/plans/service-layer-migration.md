# Service Layer Migration Plan
> Migration from legacy-api-combined.json to cbp-config-api.json

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps needed to update the CBP Admin services layer to use the new CBP Config API specification instead of the legacy API.

- [Service Updates](.cascade/context/api-migration/SERVICE_UPDATES.md) - Implementation plan for service layer updates
- [Critical Paths](.cascade/context/api-migration/CRITICAL_PATHS.md) - Core functionality and validation requirements

## Prerequisites
- [x] CBP Config API Swagger specification saved at `public/cbp-config-api.json`
- [x] Legacy API specification at `public/legacy-api-combined.json` for reference
- [ ] Critical path functionality identified for testing

### 2.1 Testing Strategy
Each service update will include minimal but effective testing:
1. Basic "happy path" test for main operations
2. Simple pagination test if applicable
3. Critical error cases only

Focus on verifying integration with the new API client rather than comprehensive test coverage.

### 2.2 Migration Steps for Each Service
1. Review current service implementation
2. Add minimal test coverage for critical paths
3. Update service to use new API client
4. Verify basic functionality works

### 2.3 Progress
- [x] Exceptions Service
  - Updated to use new API client
  - Added basic integration tests
  - Verified pagination works

- [ ] Next Service (TBD)
  - [ ] Add critical path tests
  - [ ] Update implementation
  - [ ] Verify functionality

### 3. Type System Updates
- [ ] Update TypeScript Interfaces
  - [ ] Generate new types from OpenAPI spec
  - [ ] Update existing interfaces to match new API
  - [ ] Add new type definitions
  - [ ] Remove deprecated types

### 4. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Critical Path Testing
  - [ ] Identify core business flows
  - [ ] Document manual test scenarios
  - [ ] Add minimal automated tests for critical paths
  - [ ] Create API integration tests for core endpoints

- [ ] Migration Validation
  - [ ] Compare API responses between old and new endpoints
  - [ ] Validate data transformation accuracy
  - [ ] Test error handling for common scenarios
  - [ ] Monitor performance metrics

- [ ] Post-Migration Testing Plan
  - [ ] Document areas needing test coverage
  - [ ] Prioritize test implementation
  - [ ] Create test backlog for future sprints

### 5. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update Service Documentation
  - [ ] Update method signatures
  - [ ] Update example usage
  - [ ] Document new features
  - [ ] Update troubleshooting guides

- [ ] Update Migration Guide
  - [ ] Document breaking changes
  - [ ] Provide migration examples
  - [ ] Update configuration guide

### 6. Deployment Strategy
- [ ] Version Management
  - [ ] Create new service layer version
  - [ ] Plan deprecation of old version
  - [ ] Document version compatibility

- [ ] Rollout Plan
  - [ ] Define staged rollout strategy
  - [ ] Create rollback plan
  - [ ] Update deployment scripts

### 7. Monitoring and Validation
- [ ] Update Monitoring
  - [ ] Update error tracking
  - [ ] Update performance monitoring
  - [ ] Update usage analytics

- [ ] Validation Checklist
  - [ ] Verify all endpoints working
  - [ ] Verify error handling
  - [ ] Verify performance metrics
  - [ ] Verify security requirements

## Risk Assessment
- Breaking changes in API structure
- Potential downtime during migration
- Data format incompatibilities
- Performance impacts
- Integration issues with other systems
- AI drift during long-term implementation

## AI Context Management
### Context Preservation
- [ ] Create `.cascade/context/api-migration/` directory for migration-specific context
  - [ ] `OVERVIEW.md`: Core migration objectives and principles
  - [ ] `API_CHANGES.md`: Detailed API differences documentation
  - [ ] `DECISIONS.md`: Log of architectural and implementation decisions
  - [ ] `PROGRESS.md`: Tracking file for completed milestones

### Checkpointing Strategy
- [ ] Implement regular context checkpoints
  - [ ] After Analysis Phase completion
  - [ ] After each major service update
  - [ ] After type system changes
  - [ ] After test suite updates
  - [ ] Before and after deployments

### Pattern Recognition
- [ ] Document common patterns in `.cascade/patterns/`
  - [ ] Service layer update patterns
  - [ ] Type migration patterns
  - [ ] Test adaptation patterns
  - [ ] Error handling patterns

### Drift Prevention
- [ ] Regular context validation
  - [ ] Compare current implementation against documented patterns
  - [ ] Verify adherence to API migration principles
  - [ ] Check consistency across updated services
  - [ ] Validate against original migration objectives

### Knowledge Transfer
- [ ] Create context inheritance chain
  - [ ] Link to relevant documentation in parent contexts
  - [ ] Document dependencies between services
  - [ ] Track cross-service impacts
  - [ ] Maintain decision history

### Context Recovery
- [ ] Define recovery points
  - [ ] Document key architectural decisions
  - [ ] Save working examples of migrated services
  - [ ] Store test cases demonstrating correct behavior
  - [ ] Keep reference implementations

## AI Task Context
### Active Concerns
- [ ] Track current migration phase
- [ ] Monitor service dependencies
- [ ] Track breaking changes impact

### Context Pruning Rules
- Retain only current phase details in active memory
- Load related patterns only when entering new phase
- Unload completed phase details

## Phase Management
### Phase Entry Checklist
- [ ] Load relevant patterns for phase
- [ ] Validate prerequisites
- [ ] Initialize phase-specific context
- [ ] Set success criteria

### Phase Exit Checklist
- [ ] Validate completion criteria
- [ ] Archive phase context
- [ ] Update progress tracking
- [ ] Clean up temporary context

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing
- No regression in functionality
- Performance metrics at or better than legacy
- Complete documentation
- Successful deployment in all environments
- No critical issues reported post-migration
