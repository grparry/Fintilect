   - Update section badges
   - Handle section hiding

3. Begin testing phase
   - Set up test environment
   - Write unit tests for completed components
   - Add integration tests for navigation flow

## Notes
- All core navigation components are now complete
- Layout system is fully responsive
- Animations and transitions are in place
- Permission system is the next major focus
- Testing should begin in parallel with permission implementation
