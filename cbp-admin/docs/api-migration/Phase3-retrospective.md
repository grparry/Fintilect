# Phase 3: Settings Migration Retrospective

## Completed Components

### 1. Holiday System
- Successfully aligned with API specification
- Maintained development functionality
- No outstanding questions

### 2. Configuration System
- Successfully implemented adapter pattern
- Aligned with real API structure
- No outstanding questions

## Blocked Components

### 1. Notifications System
Questions for API Team:
1. Endpoint Structure
   - Is `/api/v1/supportnotification` the correct endpoint for all notification operations?
   - What are the available operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)?
   - Are there any batch operations available?

2. Feature Support
   - Does the API support notification templates?
   - What notification types are supported?
   - What variables/placeholders are available for notifications?
   - Are there any preview/validation endpoints?

3. Data Structure
   - What is the complete schema for notification requests/responses?
   - How are notification categories handled?
   - What metadata is included in responses?

### 2. Permissions System
Questions for API Team:
1. Authentication Service
   - Is there a separate authentication service?
   - What is the endpoint structure for permission management?
   - How are role-based access controls (RBAC) handled?

2. Feature Requirements
   - What permission operations are supported?
   - How are permission groups managed?
   - Is there hierarchical permission support?
   - How are permissions validated?

3. Integration Points
   - How does the permission system interact with other services?
   - What authentication headers/tokens are required?
   - Are there any batch operations for permission management?

### 3. Security System
Questions for API Team:
1. Authentication Integration
   - Is security management part of the auth service?
   - What endpoints are available for security settings?
   - How is OTP functionality handled?

2. Feature Support
   - What security settings can be configured?
   - How is IP whitelisting managed?
   - What MFA options are supported?
   - How are security policies enforced?

3. Implementation Details
   - What is the complete schema for security settings?
   - Are there validation endpoints?
   - How are security changes audited?

### 4. Audit Log System
Questions for API Team:
1. Endpoint Structure
   - Is `/api/bill-pay/audit-log` the correct endpoint?
   - What filtering capabilities are supported?
   - Is pagination implemented differently from our current approach?

2. Data Requirements
   - What additional fields are required in audit entries?
   - Are there specific format requirements for timestamps?
   - What metadata should be included?

3. Feature Support
   - Are there any export capabilities?
   - What search/filter operations are supported?
   - Are there any aggregation or summary endpoints?

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Schedule meeting with API team to discuss:
   - Authentication service integration
   - Permission management approach
   - Security settings implementation
   - Notification system capabilities

### Documentation Needs
1. Complete API specifications for:
   - Notification endpoints
   - Permission management
   - Security settings
   - Audit log requirements

### Technical Requirements
1. Authentication service details:
   - Endpoint documentation
   - Authentication flow
   - Integration requirements

2. Data schemas for:
   - Notifications
   - Permissions
   - Security settings
   - Audit logs

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority
1. Permission Management
   - No API coverage currently available
   - Critical for application security
   - Blocking other integrations

2. Security Settings
   - No API specification available
   - Essential for production deployment
   - Potential compliance requirements

### Medium Priority
1. Notification System
   - Partial API coverage
   - Template functionality unclear
   - Migration path needed

### Low Priority
1. Audit Log System
   - Current implementation robust
   - Can maintain until API details available
   - Non-blocking for other features
