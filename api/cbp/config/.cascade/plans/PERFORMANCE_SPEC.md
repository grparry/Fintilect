# CBP Configuration API - Performance Specification

## Database Performance

### 1. Schema Optimization
```yaml
optimization:
  indexes:
    primary:
      - payment_id
      - member_id
      - payee_id
    secondary:
      - status indexes
      - date ranges
      - search fields
    covering:
      - Frequent queries
      - Status lookups
      - Date filtering
  
  partitioning:
    strategy:
      - Date-based partitioning
      - Status-based sharding
      - Archive separation
```

### 2. Query Optimization
```yaml
optimization:
  patterns:
    payment_queries:
      - Use covering indexes
      - Optimize joins
      - Minimize scans
    search_queries:
      - Efficient filtering
      - Result pagination
      - Cache frequent searches
  
  monitoring:
    - Query performance
    - Execution plans
    - Resource usage
```

## Caching Strategy

### 1. Distributed Cache
```yaml
implementation:
  search_cache:
    type: Distributed
    entities:
      - Global payee results
      - Payment status
      - Member preferences
    configuration:
      ttl: Configurable
      eviction: LRU
      replication: Enabled
  
  session_cache:
    type: Local
    entities:
      - User session
      - Request context
      - Temporary data
    configuration:
      scope: Request
      cleanup: Scheduled
```

### 2. Cache Patterns
```yaml
patterns:
  read_through:
    - Global payee data
    - Configuration data
    - Reference data
  
  write_through:
    - Status updates
    - Configuration changes
    - Preference updates
  
  invalidation:
    - Change detection
    - Version tracking
    - Dependency updates
```

## Performance Targets

      p99: 2000ms
  
  database:
    queries:
      p95: 100ms
      p99: 200ms
    transactions:
      p95: 200ms
      p99: 500ms
```

    sustained: 1000
    peak: 2000
  
  data_volume:
    daily: 1M transactions
    monthly: 30M transactions
```

## Resource Optimization

> Note: Resource management and infrastructure configurations have been moved to [INFRASTRUCTURE_SPEC.md](./INFRASTRUCTURE_SPEC.md).
