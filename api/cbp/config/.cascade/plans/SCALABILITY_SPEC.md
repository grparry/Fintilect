# CBP Configuration API - Scalability Specification

## System Architecture

> Note: Infrastructure-related scaling configurations have been moved to [INFRASTRUCTURE_SPEC.md](./INFRASTRUCTURE_SPEC.md).
> See the following sections:
> - Component Scalability
> - Resource Management
> - High Availability
> - Fault Tolerance

### 1. Scaling Patterns
```yaml
patterns:
  application:
    stateless_design:
      - Session management
      - Cache distribution
      - Configuration management
    distributed_processing:
      - Message queues
      - Event streaming
      - Batch processing
  
  data:
    partitioning:
      strategy: "Range-based"
      key: "Timestamp"
      interval: "Monthly"
    caching:
      strategy: "Distributed"
      invalidation: "Event-based"
```

## Load Management

> Note: Infrastructure-specific load management has been moved to [INFRASTRUCTURE_SPEC.md](./INFRASTRUCTURE_SPEC.md).
> See the following sections:
> - Request Processing
> - Resource Management
> - Load Balancing

### 1. Application Load Handling
```yaml
load_handling:
  throttling:
    business_rules:
      - Rate per institution
      - Concurrent operations
      - Batch size limits
    backpressure:
      - Queue depth monitoring
      - Circuit breaking
      - Load shedding
  
  optimization:
    caching:
      - Response caching
      - Data preloading
      - Result pagination
    processing:
      - Async operations
      - Batch processing
      - Background jobs
```

## Scalability Testing

> Note: Monitoring and metrics configuration has been moved to [OBSERVABILITY_SPEC.md](./OBSERVABILITY_SPEC.md).
> See the following sections:
> - Load Metrics
> - Scaling Metrics
> - Performance Monitoring

### 1. Test Strategies
```yaml
testing:
  strategies:
    load_testing:
      - Gradual load increase

      - Recovery behavior
      - Failure modes
    performance_testing:
      - Baseline performance
      - Scaling behavior
      - Resource efficiency
```

### 2. Test Scenarios
```yaml
scenarios:
  configuration_load:
    - Bulk configuration updates
    - Concurrent modifications
    - Large dataset processing

    - Resource constraints
    - Network limitations
```

## Data Management

      interval: Monthly
    archival:
      policy: Age-based
      retention: Configurable
  
  replication:
    strategy:
      type: Multi-region
      consistency: Eventually consistent
      failover: Automatic
```

### 2. Query Optimization
```yaml
optimization:
  indexing:
    strategy:
      - Covering indexes
      - Partial indexes
      - Composite indexes
    maintenance:
      - Regular rebuilds
      - Usage analysis
      - Performance monitoring
  
  caching:
    strategy:
      - Query results
      - Frequently accessed data
      - Configuration data
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Response Time
```yaml
optimization:
  latency:
    targets:
      p95: 200ms
      p99: 500ms
    strategies:
      - Connection pooling
      - Query optimization
      - Cache utilization
  
  throughput:
    targets:
      sustained: 1000 RPS
      peak: 2000 RPS
    optimization:
      - Request batching
      - Async processing
      - Resource pooling
```

### 2. Resource Efficiency
```yaml

  compute:
    optimization:
      - Workload distribution
      - Resource pooling
      - Batch processing
    monitoring:
      - Usage patterns
      - Cost metrics
      - Performance impact
  
  storage:
    optimization:
      - Data compression
      - Efficient indexing
      - Archive strategy
```

## Recovery Strategy

### 1. Disaster Recovery
```yaml
recovery:
  rpo:
    target: 15 minutes
    implementation:
      - Continuous backup
      - Point-in-time recovery
      - Cross-region replication
  
  rto:
    target: 1 hour
    implementation:
      - Automated failover
      - State recovery
      - Data consistency
```

### 2. Data Recovery
```yaml
data_recovery:
  backup:
    strategy:
      - Full backups
      - Incremental updates
      - Transaction logs
    retention:
      - Short-term: 30 days
      - Long-term: 1 year
  
  restoration:
    procedures:
      - Point-in-time recovery
      - Partial restoration
      - Consistency validation
```
