# CBP Admin CU API Integration Patterns

## Overview

This document defines the integration patterns and protocols used within the Credit Union Administrative API.

## API Integration Patterns

### REST API Patterns

```yaml
rest_patterns:
  base_url: "/api/v1"
  
  standards:
    content_type: "application/json"
    versioning: "URL-based"
    pagination:
      style: "cursor-based"
      params:
        - "cursor"
        - "limit"
    
    error_handling:
      format:
        code: "integer"
        message: "string"
        details: "object"
      categories:
        - "4xx: Client errors"
        - "5xx: Server errors"
    
    authentication:
      type: "Bearer token"
      format: "JWT"
      location: "Authorization header"
```

### Event Integration

```yaml
event_patterns:
  protocol: "AMQP"
  
  patterns:
    publish_subscribe:
      exchange: "cu.admin.events"
      types:
        - "CreditUnionEvents"
        - "UserEvents"
        - "SystemEvents"
    
    request_reply:
      exchange: "cu.admin.requests"
      timeout: "30s"
      retry:
        max_attempts: 3
        backoff: "exponential"
```

## Service Integration

### Internal Services

```yaml

        - "RevokeToken"
    
    authorization:
      protocol: "gRPC"
      service: "AuthzService"
      methods:
        - "CheckPermission"
        - "ValidateScope"
    
    audit:
      protocol: "AMQP"
      exchange: "cu.admin.audit"
      routing:
        - "user.activity"
        - "system.changes"
```

### External Services

```yaml
external_integration:
  services:
    fis_gateway:
      protocol: "HTTPS"
      authentication: "mTLS"
      endpoints:
        - "account.validate"
        - "routing.verify"
      retry:
        max_attempts: 3
        backoff: "exponential"
    
    notification:
      protocol: "HTTPS"
      authentication: "API Key"
      endpoints:
        - "email.send"
