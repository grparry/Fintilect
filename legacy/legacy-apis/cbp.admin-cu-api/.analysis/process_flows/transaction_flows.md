### Retry Pattern
```yaml
retry_pattern:
  conditions:
    - "Network timeout"
    - "Service unavailable"
    - "Rate limit exceeded"
  
  strategy:
    initial_delay: 1000
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff_multiplier: 2
    
  monitoring:
    - "Log retry attempts"
    - "Track success rates"
    - "Alert on failures"
```

### Rollback Pattern
```yaml
rollback_pattern:
  triggers:
    - "Transaction failure"
    - "Validation failure"
    - "System error"
  
  strategy:
    steps:
      1: "Log initial state"
      2: "Reverse changes"
      3: "Verify rollback"
      4: "Notify systems"
    
  monitoring:
    - "Log rollback details"
    - "Track failure patterns"
    - "Alert on failures"
```

## Transaction Monitoring

### Audit Trail
```yaml
audit_requirements:
  transaction_data:
    - "Timestamp"
    - "Admin ID"
    - "Operation"
    - "Parameters"
    - "Result"
  
  monitoring:
    - "Real-time logging"
    - "Pattern detection"
    - "Anomaly alerts"
```

### Performance Tracking
```yaml
performance_monitoring:
  metrics:
    - "Response time"
    - "Success rate"
    - "Resource usage"
    - "Error rate"
  
  thresholds:
    response_time: "2000ms"
    success_rate: "99.9%"
    error_rate: "0.1%"
```
