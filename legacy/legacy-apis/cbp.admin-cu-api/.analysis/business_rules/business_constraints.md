# CBP Admin CU API Business Constraints

## Overview

This document defines the business constraints and rules that govern the Credit Union Administrative API.

## Operational Constraints

### Processing Windows

```yaml
processing_window_constraints:
  rules:
    - name: "Minimum Window Duration"
      constraint: "ProcessingWindow.Duration >= 1 hour"
      rationale: "Ensure sufficient processing time"
    
    - name: "Maximum Windows Per Day"
      constraint: "ProcessingWindows.Count <= 3 per day"
      rationale: "Prevent excessive processing cycles"
    
    - name: "Window Spacing"
      constraint: "MinimumGap >= 30 minutes between windows"
      rationale: "Allow system maintenance"
```

### System Availability

```yaml
availability_constraints:
  rules:
    - name: "Maintenance Windows"
      constraint: "Scheduled maintenance during non-processing hours"
      exceptions: "Emergency maintenance"
    
    - name: "System Updates"
      constraint: "Updates only during maintenance windows"
      exceptions: "Critical security patches"
    
    - name: "Uptime Requirements"
      constraint: "99.9% availability during processing windows"
      measurement: "Monthly"
```

## Credit Union Constraints

### Onboarding Constraints

```yaml
onboarding_constraints:
  rules:
    - name: "Initial Setup Period"
      constraint: "Must complete setup within 30 days"
      enforcement: "Auto-suspend if not completed"
    
    - name: "Required Settings"
      constraint: "All required settings must be configured"
      items:
        - "Processing windows"
        - "Contact information"
        - "Admin user setup"
    
    - name: "Validation Period"
      constraint: "Test transactions required before activation"
      criteria:
        - "Minimum 5 successful test transactions"
        - "All error scenarios tested"
```

### Operational Limits

```yaml
operational_limits:
  rules:
    - name: "Admin User Limits"
      constraint: "Maximum 10 admin users per credit union"
      rationale: "Security and management"
    
    - name: "Concurrent Sessions"
      constraint: "Maximum 5 concurrent sessions per user"
      rationale: "Security control"
    
    - name: "API Rate Limits"
      constraint: "1000 requests per minute per credit union"
      rationale: "Resource management"
```

## Administrative Constraints

### Role Management

```yaml
role_constraints:
  rules:
    - name: "Role Assignment"
      constraint: "Must have at least one CUAdmin"
      enforcement: "System enforced"
    
    - name: "Role Modifications"
      constraint: "Only CUAdmin can modify roles"
      exceptions: "System administrators"
    
    - name: "Role Hierarchy"
      constraint: "Cannot assign role higher than own level"
      enforcement: "System enforced"
```

### Permission Management

```yaml
permission_constraints:
  rules:
    - name: "Permission Scope"
      constraint: "Limited to own credit union scope"
      enforcement: "System enforced"
    
    - name: "Critical Operations"
      constraint: "Requires dual authorization"
      operations:
        - "Status changes"
        - "Processing window modifications"
        - "Admin role changes"
    
    - name: "Audit Requirements"
      constraint: "All permission changes must be audited"
      retention: "7 years"
```

## Security Constraints

### Authentication

```yaml

  rules:
    - name: "Password Policy"
      constraints:
        - "Minimum 12 characters"
        - "Must include special characters"
        - "Must include numbers"
        - "Case sensitive"
      enforcement: "System enforced"
    
    - name: "Session Management"
      constraints:
        - "Maximum session duration: 8 hours"
        - "Idle timeout: 30 minutes"
        - "Force new session on role change"
    
    - name: "Multi-Factor Authentication"
      constraint: "Required for all admin users"
      exceptions: "None"
```

### Access Control

```yaml
access_control_constraints:
  rules:
    - name: "IP Restrictions"
      constraint: "Access limited to whitelisted IPs"
      management: "CUAdmin controlled"
    
    - name: "Time Restrictions"
      constraint: "Access limited to business hours"
      exceptions: "Emergency access protocol"
