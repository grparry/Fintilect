# CBP Admin CU API Monitoring Analysis

## Overview

This document defines the monitoring strategy and implementation for the Credit Union Administrative API.

## Monitoring Strategy

### Key Metrics

```yaml
key_metrics:
  availability:
    metrics:
      - name: "Service uptime"
        type: "Gauge"
        interval: "1 minute"
      
      - name: "Endpoint availability"
        type: "Gauge"
        labels: ["endpoint"]
        interval: "1 minute"
  
  performance:
    metrics:
      - name: "Request latency"
        type: "Histogram"
        buckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5]
      
      - name: "Request rate"
        type: "Counter"
        labels: ["endpoint", "method"]
  
  errors:
    metrics:
