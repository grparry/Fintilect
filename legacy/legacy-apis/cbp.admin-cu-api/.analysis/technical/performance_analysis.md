# CBP Admin CU API Performance Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the performance characteristics and optimization strategies for the Credit Union Administrative API.

## Performance Requirements

### Service Level Objectives

```yaml
slo:

  latency:
    percentiles:
      p95: "500ms"
      p99: "1000ms"
    measurement: "Rolling 5-minute window"
  
  throughput:
    baseline: "1000 requests/minute"
    peak: "5000 requests/minute"
    burst: "10000 requests/minute"
```

### Resource Utilization

```yaml

    request_rate:
      target: "1000 rps"
      scale_up: ">1200 rps for 2 minutes"
      scale_down: "<800 rps for 5 minutes"
  
  constraints:
    min_replicas: 2
    max_replicas: 10
    cooldown_period: "5 minutes"
```

### Vertical Scaling

      memory: "4 GB"
      suitable_for: "Development"
    
    medium:
      cpu: "4 cores"
      memory: "8 GB"
      suitable_for: "Production baseline"
