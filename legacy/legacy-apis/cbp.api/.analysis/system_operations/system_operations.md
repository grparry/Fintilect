# System Operations Analysis

## Currently Implemented Operations

### Status Service Operations
```yaml
implementation:
  status_check:
    endpoint: GET /api/status
    components:
      - Version check
      - Database connection
      - FIS API connection
    error_handling:
      - Connection timeouts
      - Service unavailable
      - Invalid response
    monitoring:
      - Health metrics
      - Response times
      - Error rates
```

### Run Service Operations
```yaml
implementation:
  manual_run:
    endpoint: POST /api/run
    components:
      - Process date validation
      - Reprocess flag
      - Run creation
    error_handling:
      - Invalid date
      - Process conflict
      - System error
    monitoring:
      - Run status
      - Duration tracking
      - Error logging
```

### System Integration Operations
```yaml
implementation:
  fis_integration:
    components:
      - Status check
      - Response validation
      - Error handling
    monitoring:
      - Connection status
      - Response times
      - Error rates
    
  database_integration:
    components:
      - Connection check
      - Transaction handling
      - Error management
    monitoring:
      - Connection pool
      - Query performance
      - Error tracking
```

## Missing Critical Operations

### Monitoring Operations
```yaml
documented_rules:
  monitoring:
    rule: "System monitoring operations"
    verification_status: partial
    expected_operations:
      - Performance metrics
      - Resource utilization
      - Error tracking
    impact: "Limited monitoring"
```

### Logging Operations
```yaml
documented_rules:
  logging:
    rule: "System logging operations"
    verification_status: partial
    expected_operations:
      - Structured logging
      - Log aggregation
      - Error tracking
    impact: "Basic logging"
```

### Maintenance Operations
```yaml
documented_rules:
  maintenance:
    rule: "System maintenance operations"
    verification_status: not_found
    expected_operations:
      - Data cleanup
      - Cache management
      - Resource optimization
    impact: "No maintenance"
```
