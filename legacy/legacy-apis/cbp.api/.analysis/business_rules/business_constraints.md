# CBP API Business Constraints

## Currently Implemented Constraints

### One-Time Payment Rules
```yaml
implementation:
  required_fields:
    - userPayeeListId: "Must be provided"
    - memberId: "Must be provided"
    - fundingAccount: "Must be provided"
    - amount: "Must be valid number"
    - willProcessDate: "Must be provided"
    - deliveryDate: "Must be provided"
  
  uniqueness_constraints:
    rule: "No duplicate payments for same payee and member"
    validation:
      - UserPayeeListId matches
      - MemberId matches
      - Amount matches
      - WillProcessDate matches
      - StatusCode = 100
      - Not suspended
    error_handling: "Return 409 Conflict"

  payment_creation:
    steps:
      1. Generate unique payment ID
      2. Create payment record with required fields
      3. Save to database
      4. Send payment notifications
    success_response: "Return 201 Created with payment ID"
```

### Recurring Payment Rules
```yaml
implementation:
  extends: "One-Time Payment Rules"
  additional_fields:
    - numPayments: "Must be provided"

    - processDay: "Calculated for monthly payments"
  
  recurring_specific:
    - Track payments processed count
    - Store last update timestamp
    - Link recurring payment to base payment
    - Generate unique recurring payment ID
```

### Payment Tracking
```yaml
implementation:
  payment_fields:
    - paymentId: "Unique identifier"
    - entryDate: "Creation timestamp"
    - lastUpdate: "Modification timestamp"

    - suspended: "Payment suspension flag"
```

### Payment Constraints
```yaml

    - Positive amount required
    - Within daily limit
    - Within monthly limit
    - Currency validation
    
  timing_rules:
    - Future dated allowed
    - Within processing window
    - Not on holidays
    - Lead time check
    
  frequency_rules:
    - Valid recurring pattern
    - End date required
    - Max occurrences check
```

### Member Constraints
```yaml
implementation:
  eligibility:
    - Active member status
    - Valid account status
    - Service enabled
    - Within limits
    
  validation:
    - Member ID check
    - Account ownership
    - Service access
    - Status verification
```

### System Constraints
```yaml
implementation:
  processing:
    - Within business hours
    - Not in maintenance
    - System available
    - Resources check
    
  capacity:
    - Batch size limits
    - Rate limiting
    - Resource quotas
    - Queue management
```

## Documented But Not Implemented Constraints

### Payment Validation Rules
```yaml
documented_rules:
  member_validation:
    rule: "Member must be active and eligible"
    verification_status: not_found
    impact: "No member status validation"
    
  account_validation:
    rule: "Account must be active with sufficient funds"
    verification_status: not_found
    impact: "No account validation before payment"
    
  payee_validation:
    rule: "Payee must be active and eligible"
    verification_status: not_found
    impact: "No payee status validation"
```

### Temporal Validation Rules
```yaml
documented_rules:
  processing_window:
    rule: "Payment must be within valid processing window"
    verification_status: not_found
    impact: "No processing window validation"
    
  business_day:
    rule: "Delivery date must be valid business day"
    verification_status: not_found
    impact: "No business day validation"
    
  cut_off_time:
    rule: "Must respect daily cut-off times"
    verification_status: not_found
    impact: "No cut-off time validation"
```

### Process Flow Rules
```yaml
documented_rules:
  state_transitions:
    rule: "Must follow valid state progression"
    verification_status: not_found
    impact: "Limited status tracking"
    
  reprocessing:
    rule: "Only failed payments can be reprocessed"
    verification_status: not_found
    impact: "No reprocessing validation"
```

### Notification Rules
```yaml
documented_rules:
  payment_notifications:
    rule: "Must send notifications for key events"
    verification_status: partial
    implementation:
      - Basic payment notifications implemented
      - No exception notifications
      - No delivery tracking
```

### Risk Management
```yaml
documented_rules:
  risk_rules:
    rule: "Risk assessment rules"
    verification_status: not_found

    - Unique payment IDs
    - Required field validation
  
  state_tracking:
    - Status code tracking
    - Last update timestamps
    - Payment suspension flags
```

### Missing Invariants
```yaml
documented_rules:
  data_validation:
