## Implementation Notes

1. Current Implementation Status:
   - Basic input validation
   - Simple business rules
   - Limited integration checks
   - Basic error handling

2. Missing Critical Components:
   - Limited security validation
   - Basic risk assessment
   - Simple compliance checks
   - Basic audit trail

3. Implementation Gaps:
   - Incomplete validations
   - Basic error handling
   - Limited monitoring
   - Simple notifications

4. Risk Assessment:
   - Missing critical validations
   - Limited security checks
   - Basic compliance
   - Simple error handling

## Verification Notes

1. Current Implementation Status:
   - Only basic required field presence validation is implemented
   - Simple duplicate payment prevention exists
   - No validation of field contents or business rules
   - No integration with external services for validation

2. Missing Critical Validations:
   - No validation of member eligibility
   - No validation of account status or balance
   - No validation of payee status
   - No validation of payment amount constraints
   - No validation of payment timing rules

3. Error Handling Gaps:
   - Only generic error codes implemented (400, 409, 500)
   - Detailed error codes documented but not implemented
   - No specific error messages for validation failures

4. Possible Sources of Unimplemented Rules:
   - May be handled by upstream systems
   - Could be requirements for future implementation
   - Might be handled by other components
   - Could have drifted from other documentation

5. Risk Assessment:
   - Current implementation relies heavily on upstream validation
   - Limited error information makes debugging difficult
   - Missing validations could lead to invalid payments
   - No protection against invalid amounts or timing
