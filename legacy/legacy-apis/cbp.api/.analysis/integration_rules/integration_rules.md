# Integration Analysis

## Currently Implemented Features

### FIS Integration
```yaml
implementation:
  operations:
    - GetCheckImage: "Retrieve check images"
    - GetPayeeByFactor: "Search payees"
    - DoesPayeeExistAtFis: "Validate payees"
    - GetStatus: "Service health"
    
  validations:
    - Status check
    - Response validation
    - Error handling
    - Logging
```

### Member Integration
```yaml
implementation:
  operations:
    - GetMember: "Member details"
    - ValidateMember: "Member status"
    - GetAccounts: "Account access"
    
  validations:
    - Member status
    - Account status
    - Access rights
```

### Notification Integration
```yaml
implementation:
  operations:
    - SendPaymentNotifications: "Payment alerts"
    - SendLargePaymentNotification: "Risk alerts"
    - SendConfirmationSummary: "Batch summaries"
    
  tracking:
    - Delivery status
    - Read receipts
    - Error handling
```

## Missing Critical Features

### Security Integration
```yaml
documented_rules:
  security:
    rule: "Enhanced security"
    verification_status: partial
    expected_features:
      - OAuth integration
      - API key rotation
      - Rate limiting
    impact: "Limited security"
```

### Monitoring Integration
```yaml
documented_rules:
  monitoring:
    rule: "System monitoring"
    verification_status: not_found
    expected_features:
      - Health checks
      - Metrics collection
      - Alert system
    impact: "No monitoring"
```

### Error Management
```yaml
documented_rules:
  error_handling:
    rule: "Error management"
    verification_status: partial
    expected_features:
      - Circuit breaking
      - Retry policies
      - Fallback strategies
    impact: "Basic error handling"
```

## Implementation Notes
