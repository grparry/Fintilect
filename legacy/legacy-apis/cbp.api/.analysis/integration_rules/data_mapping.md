# CBP API Data Mapping Rules

## Overview
Critical integration and data mapping rules that must be preserved during reimplementation.

## Payment System Integration

### Payment Processing Rules
```yaml
integration: payment_processor
type: external_system
risk_level: critical
business_impact: "Payment processing failures"

data_mapping:
  payment_request:
    source_fields:
      amount:
        transformation: "Convert to processor format"
        rules:
          - "Must be positive number"
          - "Must include exactly 2 decimal places"
          - "Must not use scientific notation"
        verification:
          - Format validation
          - Range check
          - Precision verification
        impact: "Incorrect amount processing"
        
      account_number:
        transformation: "Apply processor-specific format"
        rules:
          - "Must match processor format"
          - "Must include check digits"
          - "Must validate routing number"
        verification:
          - Format validation
          - Check digit verification
          - Routing number validation
        impact: "Payment routing failure"
        
      payment_date:
        transformation: "Convert to processor timezone"
        rules:
          - "Must be business day"
          - "Must account for cut-off time"
          - "Must handle timezone conversion"
        verification:
          - Business day validation
          - Cut-off time check
          - Timezone handling
        impact: "Incorrect processing date"

error_handling:
  response_mapping:
    processor_errors:
      INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS:
        mapping: "Return 400 with INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"
        action: "Notify user"
        retry: false
        
      INVALID_ACCOUNT:
        mapping: "Return 400 with INVALID_ACCOUNT"
        action: "Flag account for review"
        retry: false
        
      SYSTEM_ERROR:
        mapping: "Return 500 with PROCESSOR_ERROR"
        action: "Trigger retry logic"
        retry: true
```

### Member System Integration
```yaml
integration: member_service
type: internal_system
risk_level: critical
business_impact: "Member validation failures"

data_mapping:
  member_validation:
    required_fields:
      memberId:
        validation: "Must be valid UUID"
        transformation: "None - pass through"
        verification:
          - Format check
          - Existence validation
          - Status verification
        impact: "Member authentication failure"
        
      accountAccess:
        validation: "Must have payment permissions"
        transformation: "Convert to permission matrix"
        verification:
          - Permission level check
          - Service eligibility
          - Account access validation
        impact: "Unauthorized access"
```

## Protocol Requirements

### API Response Mapping
```yaml
mapping: response_codes
type: protocol_rules
risk_level: critical
business_impact: "Incorrect error handling"

status_codes:
  400:
    usage: "Client-side validation failures"
    required_fields:
      - error_code
      - error_message
      - correlation_id
    verification:
      - Error code validation
      - Message clarity check
      - Tracking ID format
      
  500:
    usage: "Server-side processing failures"
    required_fields:
      - error_code
      - correlation_id
      - retry_indicator
    verification:
      - Error categorization
      - Retry logic check
      - Monitoring trigger
```
