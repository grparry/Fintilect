# CBP API Persistence Patterns

## Overview

This document analyzes the persistence patterns in the CBP API, focusing on data storage strategies, caching mechanisms, and data access patterns.

## Data Storage Patterns

### Entity Storage

#### Payment Storage
```yaml
entity: Payment
storage_type: Relational
characteristics:
  - ACID compliant
  - Transaction support
  - Audit history
schema:
  tables:
    - payments:
        primary_key: payment_id
        indexes:
          - member_id
          - payee_id
          - status
    - payment_history:
        primary_key: history_id
        foreign_key: payment_id
        indexes:
          - timestamp
          - status_change
```

#### Payee Storage
```yaml
entity: Payee
storage_type: Hybrid
components:
  global_payees:
    type: Relational
    characteristics:
      - Reference data
      - Infrequent updates
      - High read volume
  user_payees:
    type: Document
    characteristics:
      - Flexible schema
      - Account preferences
      - User customization
```

### Cache Patterns

#### Search Cache
```yaml
type: Distributed Cache
entities:
  - Global payee search results
  - Payment status
  - Member preferences
characteristics:
  - Time-based expiration
  - LRU eviction
  - Write-through
configuration:
  ttl: TBD
  max_size: TBD
  replication: enabled
```

#### Session Cache
```yaml
type: Local Cache
entities:
  - User session data
  - Request context
  - Temporary tokens
characteristics:
  - In-memory storage
  - Request-scoped
  - Thread-safe
configuration:
  max_entries: TBD
  cleanup_interval: TBD
```

## Access Patterns

### Read Patterns

#### Query Patterns
```yaml
patterns:
  payment_queries:
    - By member ID and date range
    - By status and type
    - By payee and amount
  payee_queries:
    - By name pattern
    - By member association
    - By account status
optimization:
  - Indexed fields
  - Query denormalization
  - Result caching
```

#### Bulk Operations
```yaml
operations:
  batch_processing:
    - Payment status updates
    - Notification processing
    - History aggregation
  characteristics:
    - Chunked processing
    - Parallel execution
    - Progress tracking
```

### Write Patterns

#### Transaction Patterns
```yaml
patterns:
  payment_writes:
    type: Transactional
    consistency: Strong
    isolation: Serializable
  payee_updates:
    type: Eventually Consistent
    consistency: Eventual
    isolation: Read Committed
```

#### Audit Patterns
```yaml
audit_trail:
  entities:
    - Payment changes
    - Payee updates
    - Account modifications
  storage:
    type: Append-only
    format: Event log
    retention: Configurable
```

## Data Lifecycle

### Archival Strategy
```yaml
archival:
  criteria:
    - Age-based
    - Status-based
    - Volume-based
  process:
    - Data selection
    - Compression
    - Cold storage
  retention:
    active_data: TBD
    archived_data: TBD
```

### Cleanup Strategy
```yaml
cleanup:
  temporary_data:
    - Session data
    - Cache entries
    - Temporary files
  process:
    - Scheduled cleanup
    - Space-triggered
    - Manual initiation
```

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategy
```yaml
indexes:
  primary_indexes:
    - Payment ID
    - Member ID
    - Payee ID
  secondary_indexes:
    - Status combinations
    - Date ranges
    - Amount ranges
  composite_indexes:
    - Member + Date
    - Payee + Status
    - Status + Type
```

### Partitioning Strategy
```yaml
partitioning:
  payment_data:
    key: Member ID
    strategy: Hash
    rebalancing: Dynamic
  history_data:
    key: Timestamp
    strategy: Range
    rotation: Monthly
```

## Resilience Patterns

### Replication Strategy
```yaml
replication:
  critical_data:
    - Payment records
    - Account information
    - Audit trails
  configuration:
    mode: Synchronous
    copies: TBD
    consistency: Strong
```

### Recovery Strategy
```yaml
recovery:
  scenarios:
    - Data corruption
    - System failure
    - Network partition
  procedures:
    - Point-in-time recovery
    - Transaction replay
    - State reconstruction
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
```yaml
metrics:
  query_performance:
    - Response time
    - Throughput
    - Cache hit ratio
  storage_health:
    - Space utilization
    - IO patterns
    - Lock contention
```

### Maintenance Operations
```yaml
operations:
  scheduled:
    - Index optimization
    - Statistics update
    - Space reclamation
  on_demand:
    - Query optimization
    - Schema updates
    - Capacity planning
```
