        - Data volume
```

### Electronic Payees
```yaml
feature: electronic_payees
type: payee_feature

      verification:
        - Display rules
        - Storage format
        - API response format
```

## Configuration Storage
```yaml
implementation:
  storage:
    type: "Database table (Configuration)"
    operations:
      - Get: "Retrieve single configuration"
      - GetAll: "Retrieve all configurations"
      - Create: "Add new configuration"
      - Update: "Modify configuration"
