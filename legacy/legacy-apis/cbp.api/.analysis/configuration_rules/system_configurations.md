# CBP API System Configuration Rules

## Currently Implemented Configuration

### Basic Configuration Management
```yaml
implementation:
  storage: "Database table (Configuration)"
  operations:
    - Create new configuration
    - Get configuration by ID
    - Get all configurations
    - Update configuration
    - Delete configuration
    - Refresh configuration
  features:
    - Name-based duplicate prevention
    - Last change date tracking
    - Atomic operations
    - Race condition warnings
```

### Connection Settings
```yaml
implementation:
  database_connections:
    - ConnectBillPayWarehouse
    - ConnectBillPayCu
  api_endpoints:
    - FisApiUrl
  file_paths:
    - WrgCheckImageDirectory
  api_configuration:
    - SwaggerPrefix
```

## Documented But Not Implemented Configuration

The following configuration rules are documented but could not be found in the current implementation. These may represent requirements that were not implemented, or may have drifted in from other components.

### Processing Windows
```yaml
rule: payment_processing_window
type: timing_configuration
risk_level: critical
business_impact: "Missed payment processing deadlines"
verification_status: not_found

documented_rules:
  cut_off_time:
    rule: "Daily cut-off time for same-day processing"
    default: "15:00 EST"
    verification:
      - Time zone handling
      - Holiday calendar integration
      - Business day calculation
    impact: "Determines payment effective date"
    
  processing_days:
    rule: "Valid days for payment processing"
    configuration:
      - "Monday through Friday"
      - "Exclude federal holidays"
      - "Exclude bank holidays"
    verification:
      - Holiday calendar validation
      - Business day calculation
      - Payment date adjustment
    impact: "Affects payment scheduling and delivery"
```

### Payment Limits
```yaml
rule: payment_limits
type: transaction_limits
risk_level: critical
business_impact: "Unauthorized payment amounts"
verification_status: not_found

documented_rules:
  daily_limits:
    rule: "Maximum payment amount per day"
    verification:
      - Member level check
      - Account type validation
      - Aggregate limit calculation
    impact: "Controls payment risk exposure"
    
  monthly_limits:
    rule: "Maximum payment amount per month"
    verification:
      - Rolling calendar calculation
      - Multiple payment aggregation
      - Limit reset timing
    impact: "Controls extended risk exposure"
```

### Retry Configurations
```yaml
rule: payment_retry
type: error_handling
risk_level: critical
business_impact: "Failed payment recovery"
verification_status: not_found

documented_rules:
  retry_attempts:
    rule: "Number of retry attempts for failed payments"
    verification:
      - Failure type validation
      - Retry timing rules
      - Maximum attempt enforcement
    impact: "Affects payment reliability"
    
  retry_intervals:
    rule: "Time between retry attempts"
    verification:
      - Progressive delay calculation
      - Business hour alignment
      - Maximum retry window
    impact: "Affects recovery timing"
```

### External System Timeouts
```yaml
rule: system_timeouts
type: integration_timing
risk_level: critical
business_impact: "System integration failures"
verification_status: not_found

documented_rules:
  connection_timeouts:
    rule: "Maximum wait time for connection"
    verification:
      - System response patterns
      - Network latency analysis
      - Failure mode handling
    impact: "Affects system reliability"
    
  operation_timeouts:
    rule: "Maximum time for operation completion"
    verification:
      - Operation complexity analysis
      - Resource availability check
      - Timeout handling rules
    impact: "Affects transaction reliability"
```

## Verification Notes

1. Current Implementation Status:
   - Basic configuration management system exists
   - CRUD operations for configuration entries
   - Simple database and API endpoint configuration
   - No business rule configuration implemented

2. Missing Critical Configurations:
   - No payment processing window configuration
   - No payment limit configuration
   - No retry logic configuration
   - No timeout configuration

3. Configuration Management Gaps:
   - No validation of configuration values
   - No type-safety for configuration entries
   - No versioning of configuration changes
   - No environment-specific configuration

4. Possible Sources of Unimplemented Rules:
   - May be hardcoded in application
   - Could be managed by external systems
   - Might be handled by infrastructure
   - Could have drifted from other documentation

5. Risk Assessment:
   - Critical business rules not configurable
   - No audit trail for configuration changes
   - Limited configuration validation
   - Configuration changes require code deployment
