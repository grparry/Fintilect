# State Machine Analysis

## Currently Implemented State Machines

### Payment State Machine
```yaml
implementation:
  states:
    - Created: "Initial payment creation"
    - Validated: "All validations passed"
    - Scheduled: "Ready for processing"
    - Processing: "Being processed"
    - Completed: "Successfully processed"
    - Failed: "Processing failed"
    - Cancelled: "User cancelled"
    
  transitions:
    Created:
      - to: Validated
        trigger: "Validation success"
      - to: Failed
        trigger: "Validation failure"
        
    Validated:
      - to: Scheduled
        trigger: "Schedule success"
      - to: Failed
        trigger: "Schedule failure"
        
    Scheduled:
      - to: Processing
        trigger: "Process start"
      - to: Cancelled
        trigger: "User cancellation"
        
    Processing:
      - to: Completed
        trigger: "Process success"
      - to: Failed
        trigger: "Process failure"
```

### Payee State Machine
```yaml
implementation:
  states:
    - Created: "Initial payee creation"
    - Active: "Ready for payments"
    - Suspended: "Temporarily disabled"
    - Terminated: "Permanently disabled"
    
  transitions:
    Created:
      - to: Active
        trigger: "Validation success"
      - to: Terminated
        trigger: "Validation failure"
        
    Active:
      - to: Suspended
        trigger: "Risk trigger"
      - to: Terminated
        trigger: "Delete request"
        
    Suspended:
      - to: Active
        trigger: "Risk cleared"
      - to: Terminated
        trigger: "Delete request"
```

## Missing Critical State Machines

### Transaction State Machine
```yaml
documented_rules:
  transaction_states:
    rule: "Transaction state management"
    verification_status: not_found
    expected_states:
      - Initiated
      - Authorized
      - Settled
      - Reversed
    impact: "No transaction tracking"
```

### Notification State Machine
```yaml
documented_rules:
  notification_states:
    rule: "Notification state management"
    verification_status: partial
    expected_states:
      - Queued
      - Sent
      - Delivered
      - Failed
    impact: "Limited notification tracking"
```

### Integration State Machine
```yaml
documented_rules:
  integration_states:
    rule: "Integration state management"
    verification_status: not_found
    expected_states:
      - Connected
      - Disconnected
      - Degraded
      - Failed
    impact: "No integration monitoring"
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Current Implementation Status:
   - Basic payment states
   - Simple payee states
   - Limited state transitions
   - Basic error handling

2. Missing Critical Components:
   - No transaction states
   - Limited notification states
   - No integration states
   - Basic state tracking

3. Implementation Gaps:
   - Incomplete state transitions
   - Basic error handling
   - Limited monitoring
   - Simple notifications

4. Risk Assessment:
   - Missing critical states
   - Limited state tracking
   - Basic monitoring
   - Simple error handling
