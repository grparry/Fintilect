# CBP API Integration Patterns

## Overview

This document analyzes the integration patterns used in the CBP API, focusing on system interactions, data exchange patterns, and integration strategies.

## Core Integration Patterns

### Request-Response Patterns

#### Synchronous Operations
1. Payment Creation
   ```yaml
   pattern: Request-Response
   endpoint: /payment/one-time
   style: Synchronous
   components:
     - API Gateway
     - Validation Service
     - Payment Processor
   characteristics:
     - Immediate response required
     - Transaction boundary maintained
     - ACID properties preserved
   ```

2. Payee Search
   ```yaml
   pattern: Request-Response
   endpoint: /payee/global-payee/name/{partialName}
   style: Synchronous
   components:
     - API Gateway
     - Search Service
     - Cache Layer
   characteristics:
     - Real-time response
     - Cacheable results
     - Pagination support
   ```

#### Asynchronous Operations
1. Payment Processing
   ```yaml
   pattern: Async Request-Response
   endpoint: /payment/process
   style: Asynchronous
   components:
     - API Gateway
     - Message Queue
     - Payment Processor
     - Status Service
   characteristics:
     - Long-running operation
     - Status polling supported
     - Eventual consistency
   ```

2. Notification Delivery
   ```yaml
   pattern: Fire-and-Forget
   endpoint: /exception/send-customer-notification
   style: Asynchronous
   components:
     - API Gateway
     - Message Queue
     - Notification Service
   characteristics:
     - No immediate response needed
     - Retry mechanism built-in
     - Delivery guarantees
   ```

### Event-Driven Patterns

#### Payment Events
1. Status Updates
   ```yaml
   pattern: Publish-Subscribe
   topics:
     - payment.status.changed
     - payment.exception.created
   publishers:
     - Payment Processor
     - Exception Handler
   subscribers:
     - Notification Service
     - Audit Service
     - Status Service
   ```

2. Processing Events
   ```yaml
   pattern: Event Sourcing
   events:
     - PaymentCreated
     - PaymentValidated
     - PaymentProcessed
     - PaymentCompleted
     - PaymentFailed
   characteristics:
     - Complete audit trail
     - Event replay capability
     - State reconstruction
   ```

#### Payee Events
1. Account Updates
   ```yaml
   pattern: Event Notification
   events:
     - AccountVerified
     - AccountUpdated
     - PayeeStatusChanged
   consumers:
     - Validation Service
     - Audit Service
     - Cache Service
   ```

### Integration Styles

#### Service Integration
1. Internal Services
   ```yaml
   pattern: Microservices
   services:
     - Payment Service
     - Payee Service
     - Validation Service
     - Notification Service
   characteristics:
     - Service independence
     - Domain isolation
     - Independent deployment
   ```

2. External Services
   ```yaml
   pattern: API Gateway
   integrations:
     - Payment Processor
     - Account Verification
     - Notification Provider
   characteristics:
     - Protocol translation
     - Security enforcement
     - Rate limiting
   ```

## Data Exchange Patterns

### Synchronous Patterns
1. Direct API Calls
   ```yaml
   pattern: REST
   characteristics:
     - HTTP/HTTPS
     - JSON payloads
     - Standard methods
   security:
     - TLS encryption
     - API key authentication
     - Rate limiting
   ```

2. Service Mesh
   ```yaml
   pattern: Service Discovery
   components:
     - Service Registry
     - Load Balancer
     - Circuit Breaker
   characteristics:
     - Dynamic routing
     - Failure isolation
     - Traffic management
   ```

### Asynchronous Patterns
1. Message Queue
   ```yaml
   pattern: Message Broker
   queues:
     - payment.processing
     - notification.delivery
     - exception.handling
   characteristics:
     - Guaranteed delivery
     - Message persistence
     - Order preservation
   ```

2. Event Bus
   ```yaml
   pattern: Event Distribution
   topics:
     - payment.events
     - payee.events
     - system.events
   characteristics:
     - Pub/sub model
     - Event filtering
     - Fan-out capability
   ```

## Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breaker
```yaml
pattern: Circuit Breaker
applications:
  - External service calls
  - Database operations
  - Integration points
settings:
  failure_threshold: TBD
  reset_timeout: TBD
  monitoring: enabled
```

### Retry Pattern
```yaml
pattern: Retry
applications:
  - Payment processing
  - Account verification
  - Notification delivery
strategy:
  max_attempts: TBD
  backoff: exponential
  jitter: enabled
```

### Bulkhead Pattern
```yaml
pattern: Bulkhead
applications:
  - Service connections
  - Thread pools
  - Resource allocation
configuration:
  pool_size: TBD
  timeout: TBD
  queue_size: TBD
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks
```yaml
pattern: Health Check
endpoints:
  - /health/live
  - /health/ready
  - /health/status
metrics:
  - System health
  - Component status
  - Resource utilization
```

### Distributed Tracing
```yaml
pattern: Trace Correlation
components:
  - Request tracing
  - Error tracking
  - Performance monitoring
implementation:
  trace_id: required
  span_id: required
  baggage: optional
```
