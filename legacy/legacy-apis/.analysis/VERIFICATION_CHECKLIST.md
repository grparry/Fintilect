# Legacy API Analysis Verification Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures comprehensive and consistent analysis across all legacy APIs, with a focus on capturing all non-trivial business rules and critical logic from the legacy systems. Given the high downstream cost of missing any business rules, this checklist emphasizes thorough documentation and verification of business logic beyond basic CRUD operations.  Throughout the execution of this checklist, the AI must rigorously verify the documentation and ensure it aligns with the actual codebase.  The API must at all times avoid any drift into speculative content that doesn't align with the actual codebase.  We have no interest in documenting pattern or best practices gaps.

     - Member validation against core banking system
     - Account status verification (active/inactive/frozen)
     - Cross-CU member lookup with permissions
     - Member profile update validation

5. Multi-tenancy Requirements
   - Data Isolation
     - Credit union-specific data boundaries
     - Sponsor-level data aggregation
     - Cross-institution data sharing rules
     - Environment-specific overrides
     - Feature toggle inheritance
     - Configuration version tracking
     - Change history logging
   - Access Control
     - Institution-specific role hierarchies
     - Cross-credit union operation rules
     - Sponsor-level administrative access
     - Role assignment conflicts
     - Permission inheritance loops
     - Access denial logging
     - Role violation handling
     - Scope breach detection
     - Audit trail creation

6. Business-Specific Error Handling
   - Duplicate Prevention Rules
     - 409 for UserPayeeListId/MemberId combination duplicates
     - 409 for duplicate credit union configurations
     - 409 for overlapping holiday schedules
     - Duplicate setting definitions
     - Environment override conflicts
     - Version control conflicts
     - Concurrent update handling
   - Integration Failure Policies
     - FIS-specific retry policies and timeouts
     - Core banking system failure handling rules
     - Payment processor error recovery steps
     - Service timeouts
     - Network errors
     - Database errors
     - Integration failures
   - Business Rule Violations
     - Invalid processing window responses
     - Institution-specific validation failures
     - Cross-credit union permission denials
     - Invalid setting formats
     - Update collision handling
     - Refresh failure recovery
     - Version mismatch resolution

### Migration-Specific Requirements
1. Legacy Data Handling
   - Historical transaction preservation
   - Audit trail continuation
   - Legacy ID mapping
   - Payment history migration
   - Recurring payment schedule preservation

2. Integration Compatibility
   - Legacy FIS interface support
   - Existing core banking connections
   - Current client integration support
   - Payment processor integration maintenance

### Technical Improvements
1. Integration Modernization
   - Replace legacy FIS integration
   - Standardize retry mechanisms
   - Unify circuit breaker implementations

2. Configuration Management
   - Centralize configurations
   - Version control
   - Environment separation

3. Documentation Requirements
   - API specifications
   - Integration patterns
   - Error handling
   - Recovery procedures

### Migration Considerations
1. Data Migration
   - Schema mapping
   - Data validation
   - Historical data handling

2. Integration Cutover
   - Phased approach
   - Rollback procedures
   - Verification steps

3. Feature Parity
   - Core functionality
   - Business rules
   - Integration points

## Verification Notes
- Focus on capturing ALL business rules, no matter how minor they may seem, unless there are inherently obvious in an API project that maps HTTP endpoints to SQL database operations
- Pay attention to existing content in the .analysis directories
- Document any conditional logic that affects configuration records
- Pay special attention to validation rules that may not be obvious
- Note any cross-API dependencies that affect business logic
- Document all error conditions and their business implications
- Prioritize capturing complex workflows over simple CRUD operations
- Build upon existing analysis rather than starting fresh
