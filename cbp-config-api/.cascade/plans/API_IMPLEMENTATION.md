Last Updated: 2025-01-04 12:51 MST
Status: In Progress

## Notes
- Database schema is defined in legacy/schemas/devbillpayer.sql, but concise descriptions are provided in DATABASE_TABLES.md and DATABASE_STRUCTURE.md
- API specifications follow RESTful conventions
- All endpoints require authentication
- Refer to DATABASE_STRUCTURE.md for entity relationships
- All endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- Authentication required for all non-health check endpoints
- Using stored procedures for database operations
- Implementing proper error handling and logging
- Using TypeScript for type safety
