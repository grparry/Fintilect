# Phase 2: CBPAdmin Migration Plan

## Overview
```yaml
phase: CBPAdmin Project Migration
status: Planning
priority: High
dependencies:
  - Phase 1 (Core Meta Layer) completion
  - Workspace rules establishment
start_date: "2025-01-02"
estimated_duration: "2 weeks"

test_principle: |
  Moving the project to a new directory should not impact existing tests.
  We will maintain current test coverage and infrastructure without adding new tests.
```

## Migration Approach
```yaml
strategy: "Direct Project Migration"
rationale: |
  Move project files while preserving all existing functionality,
  tests, and infrastructure exactly as they are.

phases:
  1. Core Project Migration:
     priority: High
     status: Ready
     duration: "1 week"
     focus: "Project relocation"
     principle: "Preserve existing state"
  
  2. Pattern Integration:
     priority: Medium
     status: Deferred
     duration: "1 week"
     focus: "Pattern relationships"
```

## Phase 1: Core Migration
```yaml
status: Ready to Start
priority: High
dependencies:
  required:
    - Workspace meta layer
    - Core rules
    - Basic directory structure
  optional:
    - Pattern framework
    - Relationship mapping

steps:
  1. Project Analysis:
     - Document current structure
     - Map dependencies
     - Identify critical paths
     - List integration points
  
  2. Project Setup:
     - Create project directory
     - Copy all files (including tests)
     - Preserve directory structure
     - Maintain configurations
  
  3. Path Updates:
     - Update import paths
     - Fix dependencies
     - Update configurations
     - Preserve test setup
  
  4. Verification:
     - Run existing test suite
     - Verify build process
     - Check configurations
     - Confirm functionality

validation:
  - All existing tests pass
  - Build process works
  - No functionality changes
  - Dependencies resolved
```

## Phase 2: Pattern Migration
```yaml
status: Deferred
priority: Medium
rationale: |
  Pattern migration deferred until core project migration complete.
  This ensures:
  1. Core functionality verified first
  2. No disruption to development
  3. Pattern relationships preserved
  4. Clean inheritance model

steps:
  1. Pattern Analysis:
     - Inventory existing patterns
     - Map relationships
     - Document dependencies
     - Plan migration order
  
  2. Pattern Migration:
     - Move patterns to workspace
     - Update references
     - Verify inheritance
     - Maintain existing tests
  
  3. Validation:
     - Verify existing tests
     - Check relationships
     - Document changes

success_criteria:
  - Patterns correctly migrated
  - Existing tests unchanged
  - Relationships preserved
  - Documentation updated
```

## Risk Management
```yaml
categories:
  test_preservation:
    risk: "Existing tests break during move"
    impact: High
    mitigation: 
      - Preserve test files exactly
      - Keep configurations unchanged
      - Maintain path structures
    monitoring: "Existing test suite"

  dependencies:
    risk: "Path updates break imports"
    impact: High
    mitigation:
      - Careful path mapping
      - Systematic updates
      - Verification steps
    monitoring: "Build process"

  functionality:
    risk: "Features break during move"
    impact: High
    mitigation:
      - Preserve file structure
      - Maintain configurations
      - Systematic verification
    monitoring: "Existing tests"
```

## Validation Strategy
```yaml
principle: "Maintain Existing State"
approach:
  - Run existing test suite
  - Preserve test configurations
  - Keep current coverage
  - No new test requirements

verification:
  - Build success
  - Tests passing
  - Features working
  - Dependencies resolved
```

## Progress Tracking
```yaml
metrics:
  - Build status
  - Existing test results
  - Migration progress
  - Issue tracking

checkpoints:
  daily:
    - Build verification
    - Test execution
    - Migration status
    - Issue resolution

  weekly:
    - Overall progress
    - Risk assessment
    - Dependency check
    - Documentation update
```

## Rollback Plan
```yaml
triggers:
  - Critical test failures
  - Build system breaks
  - Pattern system fails
  - Performance degradation

steps:
  1. Stop migration
  2. Assess failure point
  3. Restore from backup
  4. Verify restoration
  5. Update migration plan
```

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 1 prerequisites
2. Set up project environment
3. Begin core migration
4. Track progress metrics
