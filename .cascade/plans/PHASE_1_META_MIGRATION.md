## Pre-Migration Analysis 
```yaml
status: Completed
artifacts:
  - .cascade/analysis/ORIGINAL_META.md
  - .cascade/analysis/PATTERN_STRUCTURE.md
  - .cascade/analysis/PATTERN_METADATA.md
  - .cascade/analysis/RELATIONSHIP_SYSTEM.md
  - .cascade/analysis/FRAMEWORK_SYSTEM.md
  - .cascade/analysis/MIGRATION_EXCEPTIONS.md
  - .cascade/analysis/PLAN_RELATIONSHIP.md
```

## Objectives
1. Establish new workspace structure
2. Migrate core AI rules
3. Prepare for pattern migration
4. Enable parallel development work

## Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Directory Foundation 
```yaml
priority: Immediate
status: Completed
goal: Create base structure for meta layer migration

completed_steps:
  1. Root Setup:
     - Created Fintilect root directory
     - Initialized .windsurfrules
     - Created .cascade directory
  
  2. Core Directories:
     - .cascade/core/
     - .cascade/patterns/
     - .cascade/analysis/
     - .cascade/metrics/
```

### Stage 2: Core Meta Layer 
```yaml
priority: Critical
status: Completed
goal: Establish workspace-level rules and AI behavior

completed_steps:
  1. Essential Files:
     - AI_CONTEXT.md (AI behavior)
     - RULES.md (workspace rules)
     - DRIFT.md (drift prevention)
     - ESSENTIAL.md (placeholder)
  
  2. Rule Categories:
     - AI interaction guidelines
     - Workspace rules
     - Project boundaries
     - Drift prevention
  
  3. Context Management:
     - Load order established
     - File purposes defined
     - Redundancy removed
```

### Stage 3: Pattern Migration 
```yaml
priority: High
status: Blocked
goal: Migrate and validate patterns
blocked_by: "CBPAdmin project migration"

pending_steps:
  1. Project Migration:
     - Move CBPAdmin to new location
     - Analyze existing patterns
     - Document relationships
  
  2. Pattern Transfer:
     - Migrate relevant patterns
     - Update references
     - Validate relationships
  
  3. Pattern System:
     - Establish inheritance
     - Define overrides
     - Document conflicts
```

### Stage 4: Framework Activation
```yaml
priority: Medium
status: Pending
goal: Activate and validate framework
depends_on: "Pattern migration completion"

steps:
  1. Framework Setup:
     - Load order verification
     - Performance monitoring
     - Error handling
  
  2. Validation:
     - Rule enforcement
     - Pattern recognition
     - Drift detection
```

## Metrics Approach
```yaml
strategy: Lightweight Performance Tracking
location: .cascade/metrics/tracker.jsonl

events:
  system:
    - Initialization
    - Core file verification
    - Performance checks
  
  patterns:
    - Registration success
    - Load time verification
    - Relationship mapping
  
  thresholds:
    load_time_ms: 100
    memory_mb: 10
```

## Timeline
```yaml
estimated_duration: 2-3 days
key_milestones:
  day_1:
    - Directory structure
    - Core rule migration
    - Initial validation
  
  day_2:
    - Pattern migration
    - Relationship mapping
    - Framework setup
  
  day_3:
    - Final validation
    - Activation
    - Documentation
```

## Dependencies
```yaml
required:
  - Access to all source files
  - Git repository setup
  - Development environment
  - Testing framework

risks:
  - Path reference updates
  - Performance regression
  - Pattern conflicts
  - Context loss

mitigation:
  - Comprehensive testing
  - Staged activation
  - Backup preservation
  - Rollback capability
```

## Success Metrics
```yaml
functionality:
  - Core rules operational
  - Patterns recognized
  - Context preserved
  - Performance maintained

validation:
  - No AI drift
  - Pattern integrity
  - Rule application
  - Error handling

performance:
  - Load time < 100ms
  - Memory usage < 10MB
  - Pattern match speed
  - Context switch time
```

## Current Status
```yaml
stage: Pattern System Validation
progress: 20%
current_focus:
  - Verifying pattern recognition
  - Testing relationship mapping
  - Validating cross-references
  - Checking performance metrics

blockers: none
risks:
  - Ensure correct pattern application
  - Maintain context integrity
  - Preserve relationships
```

## Current Focus
```yaml
active:
  - Framework preparation
  - Documentation updates
  - Metrics tracking

blocked:
  - Pattern migration (waiting for CBPAdmin)
  - Pattern validation
  - Framework activation

next_steps:
  - Prepare for CBPAdmin migration
  - Document pattern dependencies
  - Plan validation criteria
```

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Pattern System Validation
   ```yaml
   priority: Immediate
   approach: Lightweight Verification
   steps:
     - Monitor pattern recognition via metrics
     - Verify relationship mapping
     - Check performance bounds
   metrics:
     - Pattern registration events
     - Load time measurements
     - Memory usage tracking
   ```

2. Framework Integration
   ```yaml
   priority: High
   focus:
     - Core rule application
     - Pattern relationships
     - Performance monitoring
   validation:
     type: Passive Monitoring
     metrics:
       - System events
       - Performance bounds
       - Error conditions
   ```

3. Documentation Update
   ```yaml
   priority: Medium
   tasks:
     - Document metrics approach
     - Update progress status
     - Plan next phase
   ```
