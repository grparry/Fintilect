# Model Alignment Checkpoint - 2025-01-17

## Current Progress
1. Completed directory structure reorganization
   - Flattened unnecessary subdirectories
   - Consistent `-settings.json` naming pattern
   - Organized by feature area

2. Created comprehensive file migration mapping
   - Original to target path mappings
   - Categorized by type (ACH, Security, Provider, Core, Feature)
   - Updated to reflect flattened structure

3. Ready to begin validation against legacy code
   - Source file: `workspace/legacy-analyzer/output/legacy_field_data.md`
   - Plan to convert to CSV for easier analysis
   - Will validate new structure against legacy settings

## Next Steps
1. Wait for legacy data file adjustments
2. Convert legacy data to clean, sorted CSV
3. Begin validation of new structure against legacy settings
4. Document any discrepancies or missing mappings

## Reference Files
- Model Alignment Plan: `workspace/model-analyzer/plans/model-alignment-plan.md`
- Legacy Field Data: `workspace/legacy-analyzer/output/legacy_field_data.md`

## Current Structure Overview
- Settings organized by feature area (account, cards, documents, etc.)
- Flattened structure where filenames are self-descriptive
- Consistent naming pattern with `-settings.json` suffix
- Security settings moved to feature level with `-security-settings.json` suffix
