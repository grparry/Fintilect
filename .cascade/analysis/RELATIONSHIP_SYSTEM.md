## Relationship Types
1. Component Hierarchy
   ```yaml
   hierarchy:
     administrative:
       type: string
       responsibility: string
       location: string
     layout: {...}
     feature: {...}
     common: {...}
   ```

2. Dependency Rules
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     direction: string
     rules: string[]
   ```

3. Integration Mappings
   ```yaml
   integration:
     external: string[]
     internal: string[]
   ```

## Critical Elements
1. Hierarchy Management
   - Clear component types
   - Defined responsibilities
   - Location tracking
   - Dependency rules

2. Integration Tracking
   - External systems
   - Internal components
   - Service mappings
   - Resource management

3. Security Relationships
   - Component access
   - Integration points
   - Authentication flows
   - Authorization rules

## Preservation Requirements
1. Relationship Structure
   - Maintain hierarchy
   - Preserve dependencies
   - Keep mappings
   - Track flows

2. Documentation Format
   - YAML structure
   - Clear categories
   - Explicit rules
   - Location references

3. System Boundaries
   - Component boundaries
   - Integration points
   - Security perimeters
   - Domain separation

4. Validation Rules
   - Dependency checks
   - Circular prevention
   - Access control
   - Integration validation

## Migration Strategy
1. Structure Preservation
   - Keep directory organization
   - Maintain file names
   - Preserve relationships
   - Update paths

2. Content Migration
   - YAML format
   - Relationship maps
   - Rule definitions
   - System boundaries

3. Validation System
   - Dependency rules
   - Security checks
   - Integration points
   - Component hierarchy

4. Documentation Updates
   - Path references
   - System mappings
   - Integration points
   - Security boundaries
