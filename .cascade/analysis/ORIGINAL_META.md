# Original Meta Layer Analysis

## Core Principles to Preserve
1. Context Over Implementation
   - Decision rationale preservation
   - Trade-off documentation
   - Architectural boundaries
   - Pattern evolution tracking

2. Minimal Effective Documentation
   - Focus on non-obvious patterns
   - Relationship documentation
   - Architectural intent
   - Avoid implementation details

3. Machine-Optimized Structure
   - YAML format preservation
   - Clear hierarchies
   - Consistent patterns
   - Easy parsing

4. Living Documentation
   - Architecture change tracking
   - Decision history
   - Pattern evolution
   - Obsolescence management

## Critical AI Interaction Rules
1. Core Directive
   - Strict focus on explicit requests
   - No unsolicited enhancements
   - Pattern preservation focus
   - Scope control

2. Response Constraints
   - Answer only what is asked
   - No unsolicited features
   - No unauthorized patterns
   - No scope expansion

3. Enhancement Protocol
   - Only on explicit request
   - Security exception handling
   - Breaking change prevention
   - Scope maintenance

## Migration Strategy
### Phase 1: Preservation
1. Directory Structure
   ```
   .cascade/
   ├── core/           # Core principles and rules
   │   ├── RULES.md    # From original META.md
   │   └── DRIFT.md    # From AI_CONTEXT.md
   ├── patterns/       # From original patterns/
   └── decisions/      # From original decisions/
   ```

2. Content Migration
   - Preserve all YAML structures
   - Maintain hierarchy
   - Keep relationship documentation
   - Transfer decision history

3. Rule Translation
   - Map existing rules to new structure
   - Preserve all constraints
   - Maintain directive clarity
   - Keep security protocols

### Phase 2: Integration
1. CBPAdmin Specific
   - Migrate project-specific patterns
   - Preserve architectural decisions
   - Maintain relationship maps
   - Keep phase management

2. Cross-Project
   - Document shared patterns
   - Map dependencies
   - Track interactions
   - Preserve boundaries
