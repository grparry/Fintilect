# Migration Plan Relationship Analysis

## Document Hierarchy
```yaml
parent_plan: pre-migration/CBPAdmin/.cascade/decisions/migration/fintilect_migration_plan.md
child_strategy: .cascade/analysis/MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md

relationship:
  type: "implementation_detail"
  scope: "meta_layer_migration"
  status: "in_progress"
```

## Plan Integration
### Parent Plan Components
1. Mini-Project 1.1: Initial Workspace Rules âœ“
   - Created `.windsurfrules`
   - Implemented core rules
   - Established patterns
   - Set performance bounds

2. Mini-Project 1.2: Rule Analysis and Preservation
   - Focus on rule preservation
   - Category organization
   - Context preservation
   - Implementation strategy

3. Mini-Project 1.3: Workspace Integration
   - Pending detailed implementation

### Child Strategy Alignment
1. Phase 1: Core AI Rules and Meta Layer Migration
   - Implements Mini-Project 1.1 and 1.2
   - Provides detailed migration steps
   - Focuses on preservation

2. Phases 2-5: Implementation Details
   - Support Mini-Project 1.2 and 1.3
   - Provide concrete steps
   - Define validation criteria

## Next Steps
1. Immediate Actions
   ```yaml
   priority: high
   steps:
     - Update parent plan to reference MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md
     - Begin Phase 1 implementation
     - Document progress in both files
     - Track completion status
   ```

2. Integration Points
   ```yaml
   focus:
     - Maintain plan alignment
     - Track progress in both documents
     - Update completion status
     - Document learnings
   ```

3. Progress Tracking
   ```yaml
   track:
     - Phase completion
     - Plan alignment
     - Implementation status
     - Validation results
   ```
