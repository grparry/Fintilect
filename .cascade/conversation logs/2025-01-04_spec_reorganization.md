- Preserved all component scaling configurations
- Maintained resource management settings
- Included load management strategies

### 2. Security Consolidation
- Consolidated security content into SECURITY_SPEC.md
- Migrated authentication and authorization frameworks
- Preserved role-based access control
- Maintained API security settings

### 3. Observability Consolidation
- Consolidated monitoring and metrics into OBSERVABILITY_SPEC.md
- Migrated security monitoring content
- Added cross-references for monitoring content

### 4. Cross-References
- Added comprehensive links in DATA_MODEL.md
- Updated references in TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
- Added cross-references in CONFIGURATION_SPEC.md

### 5. Content Deduplication
- Removed duplicate data models
- Consolidated monitoring content
- Unified security configurations

### 6. Validation
- Verified all content migration
- Confirmed no duplicate content
- Validated all cross-references
- Ensured consistent formatting

## File Changes Summary

### Created Files
1. INFRASTRUCTURE_SPEC.md
2. INDEX.md
3. REORGANIZATION_TRACKING.md

### Modified Files
1. PERFORMANCE_SPEC.md
2. SCALABILITY_SPEC.md
3. TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
4. SECURITY_SPEC.md
5. CONFIGURATION_SPEC.md
6. DATA_MODEL.md

### Backup Files Created
1. CONFIGURATION_SPEC_SECURITY.md.bak
2. PERFORMANCE_SPEC.md.bak
3. SCALABILITY_SPEC.md.bak
4. SECURITY_SPEC.md.bak
5. TECHNICAL_SPEC.md.bak
6. TECHNICAL_SPEC_SECURITY.md.bak

## Final State
All specifications are now properly organized with clear separation of concerns:
- Infrastructure details in INFRASTRUCTURE_SPEC.md
- Security configurations in SECURITY_SPEC.md
- Monitoring and metrics in OBSERVABILITY_SPEC.md
- Core data models in DATA_MODEL.md
- Technical implementation in TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
- Configuration management in CONFIGURATION_SPEC.md

## Next Steps
The reorganization is complete with all validation checks passed. The specifications are now better organized and more maintainable.
