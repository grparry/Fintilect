# Testing Phase 1 Implementation Guard Rails
**Created**: 2025-01-02T09:17:01-07:00
**Status**: Active
**Purpose**: Prevent scope creep and maintain ROI focus

## 1. Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Navigation between list and modal views
- Modal open/close flows
- Basic URL state management
- Critical path error handling

### Out of Scope
- Performance testing
- Edge case handling beyond P1 items
- Component unit tests
- End-to-end testing
- Security testing
- State persistence
- Browser compatibility testing

## 2. Implementation Constraints

### Test Coverage
- MUST achieve 100% on P0 paths
- SHOULD achieve 70% on navigation components
- SHOULD NOT pursue coverage beyond these targets
- MUST NOT block development for non-critical tests

### Test Complexity
- MUST keep test setup under 10 lines
- SHOULD use minimal mocking
- MUST NOT create complex test utilities
- SHOULD NOT test implementation details

### Documentation
- MUST document test intent
- SHOULD provide basic examples
- MUST NOT require extensive documentation
- SHOULD NOT create complex test matrices

## 3. Decision Framework

### When to Add Tests
✅ DO add tests when:
- Testing critical user paths
- Preventing known regressions
- Validating core navigation
- Handling common errors

❌ DO NOT add tests when:
- Testing implementation details
- Handling rare edge cases
- Duplicating coverage
- Testing non-navigation features

### When to Create Utilities
✅ DO create utilities for:
- Router testing
- Basic modal testing
- Common assertions

❌ DO NOT create utilities for:
- Generic component testing
- Complex state management
- Performance testing
- Browser compatibility

## 4. Progress Tracking

### Weekly Checkpoints
- Review test additions
- Validate against guard rails
- Check development velocity
- Assess maintenance burden

### Red Flags
- Test setup complexity increasing
- Development velocity decreasing
- Test maintenance burden growing
- Coverage pursuit beyond targets
- Feature development blocking

## 5. Adjustment Protocol

### When to Adjust Course
1. Development velocity drops
2. Test maintenance increases
3. Coverage pursuit delays features
4. Test complexity grows

### How to Adjust
1. Review against guard rails
2. Remove non-critical tests
3. Simplify test patterns
4. Refocus on P0 items

## 6. Implementation Examples

### Good Implementation
```typescript
describe('ResourceWrapper', () => {
  it('opens modal when clicking list item', () => {
    render(<ResourceWrapper />);
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('list-item'));
    expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Poor Implementation (Too Complex)
```typescript
describe('ResourceWrapper', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Complex setup
    mockRouter();
    mockState();
    mockHistory();
    mockContext();
  });

  it('handles modal navigation with state', async () => {
    // Complex assertions
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(mockRouter.push).toHaveBeenCalled();
      expect(mockState.get()).toBe('modal');
      expect(mockHistory.length).toBe(2);
    });
  });
});
```

## 7. Daily Questions

Before implementing tests, ask:
1. Is this testing a critical user path?
2. Will this prevent known issues?
3. Is the test simple and maintainable?
4. Does this align with our guard rails?

Before creating utilities, ask:
1. Will this be used in multiple P0 tests?
2. Is this specific to navigation testing?
3. Can we simplify the implementation?
4. Is this really necessary?
