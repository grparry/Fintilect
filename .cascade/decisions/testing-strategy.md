# Testing Strategy

## Core Principles
```yaml
philosophy:
  - Test behavior, not implementation
  - Maintain test pyramid
  - Isolate external dependencies
  - Focus on user workflows

test_types:
  unit:
    tools: "Jest + Testing Library"
    coverage_target: 80%
    focus: 
      - Pure functions
      - Business logic
      - Component rendering
  
  integration:
    tools: "MSW + Testing Library"
    coverage_target: 60%
    focus:
      - Component interactions
      - API integration
      - State management
  
  e2e:
    tools: "Cypress"
    coverage_target: 40%
    focus:
      - Critical user paths
      - Full feature workflows
      - Cross-cutting concerns
```

## Testing Patterns
```yaml
components:
  pattern: "Behavior-driven"
  structure:
    - Render test
    - User interaction
    - State verification
  location: "__tests__/components"

services:
  pattern: "Mock external dependencies"
  structure:
    - Happy path
    - Error cases
    - Edge cases
  location: "__tests__/services"

hooks:
  pattern: "renderHook utility"
  structure:
    - Initial state
    - State transitions
    - Cleanup verification
  location: "__tests__/hooks"
```

## Mock Strategy
```yaml
approach: "MSW (Mock Service Worker)"
patterns:
  - Mock at network level
  - Maintain type safety
  - Mirror API contracts
  - Support offline development

organization:
  handlers:
    location: "src/mocks/handlers"
    pattern: "{feature}Handlers.ts"
  
  data:
    location: "src/mocks/data"
    pattern: "{feature}Data.ts"
```

## Test Data Management
```yaml
patterns:
  factories:
    tool: "Factory functions"
    location: "src/test/factories"
    naming: "{entity}Factory.ts"
  
  fixtures:
    tool: "Static JSON"
    location: "src/test/fixtures"
    naming: "{entity}.json"
  
  helpers:
    tool: "Test utilities"
    location: "src/test/helpers"
    naming: "{feature}Helpers.ts"
```
