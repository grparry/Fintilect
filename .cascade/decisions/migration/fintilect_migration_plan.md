    - cbp-admin/.cascade/

shared_code:
  location: shared/
  contents:
    - TypeScript types
    - Utility functions

    - Common patterns

legacy_preservation:
  location: legacy/
  components:
    admin_frontend:
      source: CBPAdmin
      type: React frontend
    
    apis:
      source:
        - cbp.admin-api: Admin functionality

        - cbp.api: Core business logic
      contracts: API interface definitions
      migration_target: configuration-api/
```

## Migration Context
### CBPAdmin Migration
```yaml
status: recent_project
approach: directory_restructure
rationale: |
  CBPAdmin is a recently created project with modern architecture.
  Migration primarily involves moving to the new directory structure
  while preserving the sophisticated meta layer implementation.

steps:
  - Preserve meta layer (.cascade/)
  - Move to new directory structure
  - Update path references
  - Maintain existing patterns
```

### Legacy API Strategy
```yaml
context:
  current_state:
    primary_function: Data transport layer
    architecture:
      - HTTP/HTTPS endpoints
      - SQL database interactions
      - Basic data validation
      - Simple transformations
    
    components:
      cbp.admin-api:
        purpose: Admin data operations
        type: Transport layer
      cbp.admin-cu-api:
        purpose: Credit Union data
        type: Transport layer
      cbp.api:
        purpose: Core operations
        type: Transport layer

analysis_approach:
  primary_focus:
    - Database schemas
    - Data structures
    - API contracts
    - Integration points
  
  secondary_focus:
    - Validation rules
    - Business constraints
    - Process workflows
    - Error handling

preservation_needs:
  high_value:
    - Database schemas
    - Data relationships
    - API contracts
    - Integration points
  
  selective_preservation:
    - Business rules where present
    - Validation logic if complex
    - Error handling patterns
    - Process workflows

replacement_strategy:
  scope: Nearly complete replacement
  rationale: |
    Legacy APIs primarily move data between HTTP and SQL.
    Most code can be replaced with modern patterns and
    proper separation of concerns.
  
  preserve:
    - Database knowledge
    - Data relationships
    - Critical business rules
    - Integration contracts
  
  replace:
    - Transport mechanisms
    - Basic CRUD operations
    - Simple validations
    - Error handling
```

## Migration Priorities
1. Meta Layer Preservation
   ```yaml
   priority: critical
   focus:
     - AI guidance system
     - Pattern documentation
     - Context preservation
     - Decision history

     - API contracts
     - Integration points
   rationale: |
     While legacy code will be largely replaced,
     the underlying data structures and relationships
     must be preserved and understood.
   ```

4. Business Rule Extraction
   ```yaml
   priority: medium
   focus:
     - Identify embedded rules
     - Document validations
     - Map workflows
     - Capture constraints
   rationale: |
     Though primarily data transport layers,
     legacy APIs may contain important business
     rules that should be preserved.
   ```

5. New API Development
   ```yaml
   priority: high
   focus:
     - Modern architecture patterns
     - Clean separation of concerns
     - Robust business layer
     - Type-safe contracts
   approach: |
     Build new API from scratch with proper layering,
     using preserved database knowledge and any
     discovered business rules.
   ```

## CBPAdmin Migration Plan

## Overview
```yaml
project: CBPAdmin
status: Planning
priority: High
dependencies:
  - Core meta layer completion
  - Workspace rules establishment
  - Pattern migration framework
last_updated: 2025-01-02T19:11
```

## Migration Strategy
```yaml
approach: "Two-Phase Migration"
rationale: "Separate core functionality from pattern migration"

phases:
  1. Core Migration:
     - Move project files
     - Update dependencies
     - Establish new paths
     - Basic functionality tests
  
  2. Pattern Integration:
     - Analyze existing patterns
     - Map to workspace rules
     - Migrate relevant patterns
     - Validate relationships

dependencies:
  phase_1:
    - Workspace meta layer completion
    - Core rules establishment
    - Basic directory structure
  
  phase_2:
    - Core migration completion
    - Pattern framework readiness
    - Workspace pattern validation
```

## Phase 1: Core Migration
```yaml
status: Ready to Start
blocked_by: null
priority: High

steps:
  1. Project Setup:
     - Create new project directory
     - Copy core files
     - Update paths
     - Verify structure
  
  2. Dependency Updates:
     - Update imports
     - Fix references
     - Test core functionality
  
  3. Basic Validation:
     - Run test suite
     - Check core features
     - Verify integrations

success_criteria:
  - Project builds successfully
  - Core features functional
  - Tests passing
  - Dependencies resolved
```

## Phase 2: Pattern Migration
```yaml
status: Deferred
blocked_by: "Core migration completion"
priority: Medium

rationale: |
  Pattern migration deferred until core project migration complete.
  This ensures:
  1. Patterns migrate to stable environment
  2. Core functionality verified first
  3. Pattern relationships preserved
  4. No disruption to development

steps:
  1. Pattern Analysis:
     - Inventory existing patterns
     - Map relationships
     - Identify dependencies
     - Document context
  
  2. Pattern Migration:
     - Transfer to workspace
     - Update references
     - Verify inheritance
     - Test relationships
  
  3. Pattern Validation:
     - Test pattern recognition
     - Verify relationships
     - Check inheritance
     - Document changes

success_criteria:
  - Patterns correctly migrated
  - Relationships preserved
  - Inheritance working
  - Documentation updated
```

## Current Status
```yaml
completed:
  - Initial planning
  - Dependency analysis
  - Migration strategy

in_progress:
  - Core migration preparation
  - Directory structure planning
  - Test suite preparation

blocked:
  - Pattern migration (intentionally deferred)
  - Pattern framework integration
  - Relationship mapping

next_steps:
  1. Begin Phase 1 core migration
  2. Update project references
  3. Run initial tests
  4. Document progress
```

## Risk Management
```yaml
risks:
  pattern_deferral:
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Document all pattern relationships before core migration"
    monitoring: "Track pattern usage in current development"

  core_migration:
    impact: "High"
    mitigation: "Comprehensive test coverage before migration"
    monitoring: "Continuous integration checks"

  dependencies:
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Update dependency map before migration"
    monitoring: "Dependency validation tests"
```

## Success Metrics
```yaml
phase_1:
  - Core functionality preserved
  - Build pipeline successful
  - Tests passing
  - Dependencies resolved

phase_2:
  - Patterns correctly migrated
  - Relationships maintained
  - Documentation complete
