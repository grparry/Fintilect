# Phase Management Framework
**Created**: 2025-01-02T16:28:35-07:00
**Status**: Active
**Purpose**: Define phase management patterns for AI-speed development

## 1. Phase Lifecycle

### 1.1 Phase Definition
```yaml
phase:
  attributes:
    - name: string
    - objectives: string[]
    - dependencies: string[]
    - patterns: string[]
    - guardrails: string[]
  
  states:
    - not_started
    - in_progress
    - completed
    - validated
```

### 1.2 Phase Transitions
```yaml
transition_requirements:
  pre_transition:
    - objectives_met: boolean
    - patterns_documented: boolean
    - guardrails_validated: boolean
    - dependencies_satisfied: boolean
  
  validation:
    - metrics_updated: boolean
    - gaps_documented: boolean
    - patterns_consolidated: boolean
```

## 2. Timeline Management

### 2.1 AI-Speed Execution
```yaml
execution_model:
  type: "continuous"
  checkpoints:
    - type: "phase_entry"
      requirements: ["pre_transition_check"]
    - type: "phase_execution"
      requirements: ["continuous_validation"]
    - type: "phase_completion"
      requirements: ["post_transition_check"]
```

### 2.2 Progress Tracking
```yaml
tracking:
  metrics:
    - type: "phase_progress"
      attributes: ["objectives", "patterns", "gaps"]
    - type: "compliance"
      attributes: ["guardrails", "patterns"]
  
  validation:
    frequency: "continuous"
    focus: ["patterns", "guardrails", "relationships"]
```

## 3. Pattern Evolution

### 3.1 Pattern Lifecycle
```yaml
pattern:
  states:
    - proposed
    - implemented
    - validated
    - evolved
  
  relationships:
    tracking:
      - dependencies
      - impacts
      - evolution
```

### 3.2 Pattern Validation
```yaml
validation:
  checks:
    - pattern_compliance
    - guardrail_alignment
    - relationship_integrity
  
  frequency: "per_phase"
  documentation: "required"
```

## 4. Relationship Management

### 4.1 Cross-Phase Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  types:
    - pattern_dependency
    - phase_dependency
    - guardrail_dependency
  
  tracking:
    method: "graph"
    validation: "continuous"
```

### 4.2 Impact Analysis
```yaml
impact:
  scope:
    - patterns
    - guardrails
    - timelines
  
  tracking:
    method: "matrix"
    update: "continuous"
```

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Phase Implementation
1. Always validate phase entry criteria
2. Continuously check guardrail compliance
3. Document pattern evolution
4. Track relationship changes

### 5.2 Pattern Implementation
1. Follow pattern lifecycle states
2. Maintain relationship integrity
3. Document evolution clearly
4. Validate against guardrails

### 5.3 Timeline Management
1. Focus on phase completion over time
2. Track progress continuously
3. Validate transitions thoroughly
4. Document completion criteria
