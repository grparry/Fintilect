# Phase 1 Testing Implementation - Navigation Focus
**Created**: 2025-01-02T09:13:30-07:00
**Status**: Draft
**Category**: Implementation Planning
**Focus**: Core Navigation Testing
**Guard Rails**: [Testing Phase 1 Guard Rails](testing-phase1-guardrails.md)

## Implementation Boundaries
This implementation plan is strictly governed by the guard rails defined in [testing-phase1-guardrails.md](testing-phase1-guardrails.md). All implementation decisions must align with these guard rails to maintain focus and prevent scope creep.

## 1. Objectives
- Test critical navigation paths (per guard rails section 1)
- Validate modal navigation flows (per guard rails section 1)
- Ensure basic URL state management (per guard rails section 1)
- Create minimal, reusable test patterns (per guard rails section 2)

## 2. Critical Path Testing Matrix
All test cases below are validated against guard rails section 3 "Decision Framework"

### ResourceWrapper Component (Client Management)
| Test Case | Priority | Rationale | Guard Rails Alignment |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| List → Modal Flow | P0 | Primary user path | Section 3.1 - Critical user paths |
| Modal → List Flow | P0 | Primary user path | Section 3.1 - Critical user paths |
| Error Handling | P1 | Common edge case | Section 3.1 - Common errors |

### Modal Navigation
| Test Case | Priority | Rationale | Guard Rails Alignment |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Open/Close Flow | P0 | Core functionality | Section 3.1 - Core navigation |
| URL Sync | P0 | State consistency | Section 3.1 - Critical user paths |
| Back Button | P1 | User experience | Section 3.1 - Core navigation |

## 3. Implementation Schedule
Schedule is designed to align with guard rails section 4 "Progress Tracking"

### Week 1: Core Navigation (Jan 2-9)
- Set up minimal test environment (per guard rails section 2)
- Implement ResourceWrapper critical paths
- Document initial patterns
- Daily guard rails alignment check

### Week 2: Modal Flows (Jan 10-16)
- Implement modal navigation tests
- Add basic error handling
- Refine patterns
- Weekly guard rails review

### Week 3-4: Refinement (Jan 17-30)
- Address critical gaps (within guard rails scope)
- Improve documentation (per guard rails section 2)
- Knowledge transfer
- Final guard rails compliance check

## 4. Success Criteria
All criteria must align with guard rails sections 1-4:
- Critical navigation paths tested
- Modal flows validated
- Basic error handling in place
- Patterns documented (within complexity limits)
- Team can maintain tests

## 5. Risk Management
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Development slowdown | Focus on critical paths only |
| Test maintenance | Keep tests simple and focused |
| Knowledge sharing | Clear documentation of patterns |
| Red Flags and Course Correction | As defined in guard rails section 4 "Red Flags" |

## 6. Weekly Review Checklist
1. Review test additions against guard rails section 3
2. Validate test complexity against section 2
3. Check for scope creep against section 1
4. Assess team velocity impact
5. Review documentation standards

## Deliverables
- Essential test suites
- Basic test utilities
- Pattern documentation
- Team guidelines
