# State Management Decision Record

## Current Approach
```yaml
pattern: Context + Reducers
rationale:
  - Complex nested state requirements
  - Need for predictable updates
  - Performance considerations with large datasets
constraints:
  - Must support offline capabilities
  - Must handle concurrent updates
  - Must maintain referential integrity
```

## Evolution
```yaml
changes:
  - date: "2023-12-15"
    change: "Adopted Context API over Redux"
    reason: "Simpler mental model, sufficient for needs"
  - date: "2024-01-01"
    change: "Added local state persistence"
    reason: "Offline requirements"
```

## Implementation Guidelines
```yaml
rules:
  - One context per major feature
  - Use reducers for complex state
  - Persist only necessary state
  - Clear loading/error states

locations:
  contexts: src/context
  reducers: src/context/{feature}/reducer.ts
  types: src/types/{feature}.types.ts

patterns:
  - Split complex state into feature-specific contexts
  - Use composition for shared state
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Handle loading states consistently
```

## Current Implementation
```yaml
major_contexts:
  BillPayContext:
    purpose: "Manage bill payment state"
    location: src/context/bill-pay/BillPayContext.tsx
    features:
      - Payment processing
      - Configuration
      - Audit logging
  
  SecurityContext:
    purpose: "Handle authentication and permissions"
    location: src/context/security/SecurityContext.tsx
    features:
      - User authentication
      - Permission checking
      - Role management
```
