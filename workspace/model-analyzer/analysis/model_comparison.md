# Model Comparison Analysis

## Overview
This document tracks the comparison between legacy C# models and current JSON models.

## Analysis Method
1. Compare setting keys between legacy and current models
2. Track structural differences
3. Identify potential duplications
4. Flag missing or extra settings

## Current Progress

### Analyzed Namespaces
- [ ] ADACompliance
- [ ] Account
- [ ] Admin
- [ ] Application
- [ ] CardManagement
- [ ] MobileConfigurations

### Key Differences Found
1. **Structure**
   - Legacy: Hierarchical C# classes with strong typing
   - Current: Flat JSON files with implicit typing

2. **Organization**
   - Legacy: Namespace-based grouping
   - Current: Directory-based grouping

3. **Type Safety**
   - Legacy: Strict typing with validation
   - Current: Loose typing with schema validation

## Next Steps
1. Complete detailed analysis of each namespace
2. Document all duplications found
3. Create mapping of legacy to current models
4. Identify areas for consolidation

## Notes
- Track findings for each namespace here
- Document any inconsistencies or concerns
- Note patterns that should be preserved or changed
