# API Migration Plan

## Progress Summary
Last Updated: 2024-12-30

### Phase Status
- Phase 1 (Client Management): Completed 
- Phase 2 (Payment Processing): Completed
- Phase 3 (API Pattern Alignment): In Progress
- Phase 4 (Report Integration): Not Started

### Next Actions
- Continue Phase 3: API Pattern Alignment
- Verify implementation against endpoint specifications
- Document any deviations from specified patterns

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for migrating the CBPAdmin UI to work with both mock and real API endpoints. The API patterns are documented in the `docs/api-migration/endpoints` directory, which serves as the source of truth for endpoint specifications.

### Reference Documentation
- API Endpoint Specifications: `docs/api-migration/endpoints/*.md`
- Implementation Details: `Phase3-preimplementation.md`
- Success Criteria: Defined per endpoint in specification files

```

## Core Migration Principles
1. Seamless Environment Switching
   - All components must support switching between mock and real APIs
   - Use environment variables for API selection
   - Maintain consistent response structures

2. Type Safety
   - Strong typing for all requests and responses
   - Shared types between mock and real implementations
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. Development Continuity
   - Maintain full CRUD in mock environment
   - Align read operations with real API
   - Document feature gaps between environments

## Implementation Patterns
1. Adapter Pattern
   - Used when mock and API formats differ
   - Maintains consistent interface for components
   - Examples: Configuration System

2. Direct Integration
   - Used when formats already align
   - Minimal transformation needed
   - Examples: Holiday System

3. Mock Preservation
   - Used when API specs unavailable
   - Maintains development capabilities
   - Examples: Permissions, Security

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Mock Data Strategy
- Evaluate existing mock data directories
- Consolidate mock data in dedicated files under `src/mocks/{feature-area}`
- Include complete objects with all required fields
- Export mock arrays to allow manipulation in mock handlers
- Follow consistent naming: `mock{Entity}Data.ts`

### API Response Handling
- Use `ApiSuccessResponse<T>` type consistently
- Access data via `response.data.data`
- Delegate error handling to base `api` class
- Simulate realistic delays in mock mode

### Service Layer Architecture
- Follow singleton pattern for services
- Delegate to API classes for data operations
- Control mock data via environment configuration
- Implement consistent error handling

### Testing Strategy
For each phase:
1. Define phase-specific test scenarios
2. Include common edge cases
3. Test with mock data first
4. Validate all CRUD operations
5. Document phase-specific behaviors

## Risk Mitigation Process

### Development Workflow
- Break down changes into small, reviewable chunks
- Implement one major feature at a time
- Maintain detailed commit messages for tracking changes
- Use TODO comments to mark areas needing attention

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before implementing new features
- Run full test suite before each commit
- Focus on critical path testing
- Maintain a list of manual test scenarios

### Safety Mechanisms
- Feature flags for all new functionality
- Console logging for debugging in development
- Error boundaries in React components
- Type-safe API calls with runtime checks

### Documentation
- Update documentation inline with code changes
- Document key decisions in commit messages
- Keep a running list of known issues
- Document rollback steps for each feature

### Quality Checks
For each implementation step:
- TypeScript compilation with strict mode
- No eslint-disable comments
- Tests for critical functionality
- Console logging for debugging
- Feature flag implementation

### Rollback Plan
- Keep old implementation alongside new code
