# Phase 3: API Pattern Alignment Pre-Implementation Analysis

## Existing Patterns Analysis

### API Structure
- Base API configuration in `src/config/api.config.ts`
- Standard response type `ApiSuccessResponse<T>`
- Read-only endpoints in real API
- Mock handlers for full CRUD operations

### Service Layer
- Services extend BaseApi
- GET operations align with API
- Mock CRUD operations maintained
- Type-safe request/response

### Mock Data
- Stored in dedicated files under `src/mocks/{feature-area}`
- Follows `mock{Entity}Data.ts` naming convention
- Must match API GET response structure
- Maintains full CRUD functionality

## Endpoint Documentation
All API patterns and specifications are documented in `docs/api-migration/endpoints/*.md`. These specifications serve as the source of truth for implementation.

## Configuration System Analysis

### Current State (from configuration-management.md)
- Mock endpoint: `/bill-pay/config` (GET/PUT)
- Real API endpoint: `/configuration/all` (GET only)
- Discrepancy in endpoint structure and capabilities
- Need to map between mock and real API responses

### Required Changes
1. Service Layer
   - [x] Create adapter for `/configuration/all` endpoint
   - [x] Map API response to BillPayConfig structure
   - [x] Maintain mock CRUD for development

2. Mock Handlers

#### Implementation Details
1. Created adapter pattern to map between API formats:
   - Real API: `/configuration/all` (GET only)
   - Mock API: `/bill-pay/config` (GET/PUT)
   - Adapter: `BillPayConfigAdapter` handles conversion

2. Type Definitions:
   - `SystemConfiguration`: Real API response type
   - `BillPayConfig`: UI/Mock data type
   - `ConfigurationCategory`: Enum for config categories

3. Mock Handler Updates:
   - Added `/configuration/all` endpoint
   - Maintained development CRUD operations
   - Consistent response format with `ApiSuccessResponse`

4. Service Layer Changes:
   - Environment-aware routing (mock vs real)
   - Type-safe request/response handling
   - Clear error messages for unsupported operations

#### Next Steps
1. Notifications System
   - Review current implementation
   - Check API patterns
   - Plan adapter if needed

### Phase 3: MSW Handlers
- [ ] Standardize GET responses
  - [ ] Use ApiSuccessResponse
  - [ ] Match API formats
  - [ ] Keep mutation handlers
- [ ] Document patterns
  - [ ] GET response structure
  - [ ] Mock CRUD patterns
  - [ ] Testing approach

## Success Criteria
1. [x] Implementation follows endpoint specs
2. [x] GET responses match API format

4. [ ] Mapping layer handles differences
5. [ ] Documentation reflects current state

## Current Status
1. Holiday System (Completed)

2. Configuration System (Completed)
   - Implemented adapter pattern
   - Aligned with real API structure
   - Maintained development functionality
   - Added comprehensive type safety

3. Notifications (Future Task)
   - Significant differences between mock and API:
     - Different endpoint structure (/notification-templates vs /api/v1/supportnotification)
     - Different feature sets (templates vs. support notifications)
     - Incomplete API specifications
   - Needs further investigation:
     - Complete API documentation
     - Decision on template feature handling
     - Migration strategy for existing features

4. Permissions (Blocked)
   - No API coverage currently available
   - High priority gap in API specification
   - Potential solutions to investigate:
     - Separate authentication service integration
     - New API endpoints implementation
     - Alternative permission management strategy
   - Maintaining mock implementation for now

5. Security (Blocked)
   - No API specification available
   - Similar to Permissions, likely part of auth service
   - Current features:
     - Security settings management
     - OTP functionality
     - IP whitelisting
   - Next steps:
     - Identify auth service integration points
     - Determine security settings management
     - Plan OTP implementation strategy
   - Maintaining mock implementation for now

6. Audit Log (Ready)
   - Current implementation:
     - GET endpoint with comprehensive filtering

     - Support for search, date range, and pagination
     - Meta information in responses
   - Next steps:
     - Verify API endpoint alignment
     - Create adapter if needed
     - Ensure filtering capabilities match API
   - Ready for implementation with minimal changes

## Implementation Plan
1. Complete Audit Log implementation
   - Verify API endpoint structure
   - Implement adapter if needed
   - Maintain existing filtering capabilities
   - Add any missing API features

2. Investigate Auth Service
   - Review Permissions requirements
   - Review Security requirements
   - Plan integration strategy

3. Document API Gaps
