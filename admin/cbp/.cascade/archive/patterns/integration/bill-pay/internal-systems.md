## Administrative Guidelines
```yaml
management_principles:
  oversight:
    focus:
      - Component health
      - Service coordination
      - Performance efficiency
      - Compliance status
    
    priorities:
      - Critical services
      - System alignment
      - Resource constraints
      - Security risks
    
    escalation:
      - Alert thresholds
      - Response times
      - Impact severity
      - Resolution paths

  coordination:
    responsibilities:
      - Service monitoring
      - System oversight
      - Resource management
      - Compliance tracking
    
    communication:
      - Status updates
      - Service alerts
      - Resource notices
      - Compliance reports
    
    documentation:
      - Service records
      - System logs
      - Resource data
      - Compliance files
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  disconnected_oversight:
    description: "Isolated service management"
    instead: "Coordinated administration"
    reasons:
      - Reduces visibility
      - Increases complexity
      - Hampers coordination
      - Compromises control
    
  reactive_monitoring:
    description: "Response-based oversight"
    instead: "Proactive management"
    reasons:
      - Delays detection
      - Increases risks
      - Reduces efficiency
      - Impacts reliability
    
  incomplete_compliance:
    description: "Partial compliance tracking"
    instead: "Comprehensive monitoring"
    reasons:
      - Missing requirements
      - Audit gaps
      - Security risks
      - Compliance issues
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
