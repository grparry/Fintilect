## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  disconnected_oversight:
    description: "Isolated integration management"
    instead: "Coordinated administration"
    reasons:
      - Reduces visibility
      - Increases complexity
      - Hampers coordination
      - Compromises control
    
  reactive_monitoring:
    description: "Response-based oversight"
    instead: "Proactive management"
    reasons:
      - Delays detection
      - Increases risks
      - Reduces efficiency
      - Impacts reliability
    
  incomplete_compliance:
    description: "Partial compliance tracking"
    instead: "Comprehensive monitoring"
    reasons:
      - Missing requirements
      - Audit gaps
      - Security risks
      - Compliance issues
```
