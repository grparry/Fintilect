# Client Management Access Control

## Organization-Wide Permissions
```yaml
pattern:
  strategy: "Multi-level group hierarchy"
  scope: "Organization Management"
  isolation: "Independent from bill pay system"

components:
  location: "src/components/client-management"
  implementation:
    - Group hierarchy management
    - Cross-domain role definitions
    - Organization-wide permissions
    - Independent security context

types:
  - SecurityRole interface
  - Permission interface
  - UserGroup interface
  - PermissionCategoryType
```

## Access Control Rules
```yaml
group_hierarchy:
  - Multi-level group management
  - Role inheritance within org
  - Cross-system permission policies
  - No overlap with bill pay

permission_management:
  - Organization-wide roles
  - Group-based access control
  - Independent role definitions
  - Separate from bill pay permissions

data_protection:
  - Organization-level security
  - Group-based data access
  - Independent state management
  - System isolation
```

## Performance Monitoring
```yaml
measurements:
  - Group hierarchy operations
  - Permission resolution time
  - Role validation speed
  - Cross-system checks

implementation:
  - Use GlobalProfiler
  - Track hierarchy traversal
  - Monitor permission checks
  - Log system boundaries
```

## System Boundaries
```yaml
isolation_rules:
  - No permission inheritance from bill pay
  - Separate management interfaces
  - Independent role definitions
  - Clear system boundaries

future_considerations:
  - Document separation rationale
  - Maintain clear boundaries
  - Track integration points
  - Preserve domain requirements
```
