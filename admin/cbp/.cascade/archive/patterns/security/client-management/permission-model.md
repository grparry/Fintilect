# Client Management Permission Model

## Core Principles
```yaml
purpose: "Organization-wide permission management"
key_aspects:
  - Permission hierarchy
  - Role-based access
  - Delegation model
  - Audit requirements
```

## Permission Structure
```yaml
hierarchy_model:
  pattern: "Permission Hierarchy"
  levels:
    organization:
      permissions:
        - Global settings
        - System configuration
        - Organization management
      scope:
        - All groups
        - All users
        - All resources
    
    group:
      permissions:
        - Group management
        - Member administration
        - Resource access
      scope:
        - Group resources
        - Group members
        - Subgroups
    
    user:
      permissions:
        - Profile management
        - Resource usage
        - Personal settings
      scope:
        - Personal resources
        - Assigned access
        - Direct permissions

inheritance_rules:
  pattern: "Permission Flow"
  implementation:
    propagation:
      - Top-down flow
      - Scope limitations
      - Override rules
    
    combination:
      - Permission merging
      - Conflict resolution
      - Priority handling
    
    restrictions:
      - Boundary enforcement
      - Scope limitations
      - Isolation rules
```

## Role Integration
```yaml
role_mapping:
  pattern: "Role-Permission Binding"
  implementation:
    definition:
      - Permission sets
      - Scope rules
      - Constraints
    
    assignment:
      - Role allocation
      - Permission activation
      - Scope binding
    
    management:
      - Role updates
      - Permission sync
      - Audit tracking

delegation_model:
  pattern: "Permission Delegation"
  implementation:
    rules:
      - Delegation scope
      - Time limits
      - Restrictions
    
    tracking:
      - Delegation chain
      - Authority source
      - History logging
    
    revocation:
      - Clean removal
      - Chain updates
      - State cleanup
```

## Access Control
```yaml
permission_enforcement:
  pattern: "Access Validation"
  implementation:
    checking:
      - Permission validation
      - Scope verification
      - Context evaluation
    
    resolution:
      - Permission combining
      - Conflict handling
      - Decision making
    
    logging:
      - Access attempts
      - Decision basis
      - Context capture

scope_management:
  pattern: "Permission Scope"
  implementation:
    definition:
      - Resource bounds
      - Action limits
      - Time constraints
    
    enforcement:
      - Boundary checking
      - Limit validation
      - Time tracking
    
    auditing:
      - Scope changes
      - Access patterns
      - Violation attempts
```

## Security Integration
```yaml
security_context:
  pattern: "Permission Context"
  implementation:
    setup:
      - Context loading
      - Permission resolution
      - Scope determination
    
    maintenance:
      - Context updates
      - Permission sync
      - Scope validation
    
    cleanup:
      - Context cleanup
      - State finalization
      - History recording

boundary_protection:
  pattern: "Permission Boundaries"
  implementation:
    validation:
      - Boundary checks
      - Scope verification
      - Context evaluation
    
    enforcement:
      - Access control
      - Scope limitation
      - Violation handling
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  permission_caching:
    why: "Security bypass"
    instead: "Real-time checking"
    
  scope_bypass:
    why: "Boundary violation"
    instead: "Strict enforcement"
    
  context_sharing:
    why: "Security leak"
    instead: "Context isolation"
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
approach:
  permission_tests:
    - Hierarchy validation
    - Inheritance flow
    - Delegation rules
    
  security_tests:
    - Access control
    - Boundary enforcement
    - Context preservation
    
  performance_tests:
    - Resolution speed
    - Scope checking
    - Context handling
```

## Monitoring Guidelines
```yaml
observability:
  metrics:
    - Permission changes
    - Access patterns
    - Violation attempts
    
  logging:
    - Permission updates
    - Access decisions
    - Context changes
    
  alerting:
    - Security violations
    - Unusual patterns
    - System issues
```
