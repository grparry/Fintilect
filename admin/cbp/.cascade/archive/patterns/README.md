# Patterns

This directory contains architectural and design patterns used throughout the CBP Admin system.

## Directory Structure
```yaml
patterns/:
  core/: "Fundamental patterns used across the system"
  security/: "Security and access control patterns"
  integration/: "External system integration patterns"
  domain/: "Domain-specific business patterns"
```

## Meta-Layer Documentation

## Purpose
This meta-layer provides architectural patterns, decisions, and relationships that guide the development and maintenance of the CBPAdmin system.

## Guiding Principles

### AI-Centric Design
1. **AI as Primary Consumer**: The meta-layer is designed primarily for AI consumption and maintenance, not human documentation
2. **Critical Context**: Focus on providing essential context without adding unnecessary processing overhead
3. **AI Maintainability**: Structure documentation to be easily maintained and updated by AI systems

### Pattern Structure
1. **Consistency**: All patterns follow standardized templates for predictable processing
2. **Metadata-Driven**: Use frontmatter for quick context loading and relationship tracking
3. **Direct Impact**: Maintain clear, direct relationships between patterns
4. **Clear Hierarchy**: Patterns are categorized by their primary concern
5. **Cross-Cutting**: Related patterns are connected through metadata

### Documentation Standards
1. **Minimal Redundancy**: Avoid repeating information across patterns
2. **Active Maintenance**: Regular validation and updates of pattern metadata
3. **Version Control**: Outdated patterns are marked as deprecated before removal
4. **Template Usage**: New patterns must use the standard template

## Pattern Types

### Core Patterns
Fundamental architectural patterns that define system-wide behavior.

### Security Patterns
Domain-specific security implementations and controls.

### Integration Patterns
System integration and communication patterns.

### Component Patterns
UI and interaction implementation patterns.
