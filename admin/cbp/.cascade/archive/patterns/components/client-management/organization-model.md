## Administrative Guidelines
```yaml
management_principles:
  oversight:
    focus:
      - Structure integrity
      - Access control
      - Compliance status
      - Audit completeness
    
    priorities:
      - Critical changes
      - Access issues
      - Compliance gaps
      - Audit concerns
    
    escalation:
      - Alert levels
      - Response times
      - Impact severity
      - Resolution paths

  coordination:
    responsibilities:
      - Change management
      - Access oversight
      - Compliance monitoring
      - Audit administration
    
    communication:
      - Status updates
      - Change notifications
      - Compliance alerts
      - Audit findings
    
    documentation:
      - Change records
      - Access logs
      - Compliance reports
      - Audit trails
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  direct_modification:
    description: "Direct structure changes"
    instead: "Use administrative workflows"
    reasons:
      - Breaks audit trail
      - Bypasses validation
      - Compromises compliance
      - Reduces transparency
    
  manual_access:
    description: "Manual access changes"
    instead: "Use access management system"
    reasons:
      - Inconsistent control
      - Missing audit trail
      - Compliance risks
      - Security gaps
    
  delayed_auditing:
    description: "Reactive audit reviews"
    instead: "Proactive audit monitoring"
    reasons:
      - Missed violations
      - Delayed detection
      - Compliance gaps
      - Reduced oversight
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
administrative_testing:
  structure_validation:
    focus:
      - Organization integrity
      - Change management
      - Error handling
      - Compliance checks
    
    scenarios:
      - Structure updates
      - Configuration changes
      - Error conditions
      - Compliance events
    
    verification:
      - Structure integrity
      - Change accuracy
      - Error handling
      - Compliance status

  access_validation:
    focus:
      - Role management
      - Permission control
      - Access patterns
      - Usage tracking
    
    scenarios:
      - Role changes
      - Permission updates
      - Access requests
      - Usage patterns
    
    verification:
      - Role accuracy
      - Permission validity
      - Access control
      - Usage compliance
```
