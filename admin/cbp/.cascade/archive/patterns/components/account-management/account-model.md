## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  direct_implementation:
    description: "Implementing core processing logic"
    instead: "Monitor and coordinate core systems"
    reasons:
      - Violates separation of concerns
      - Increases maintenance complexity
      - Reduces system reliability
      - Complicates upgrades
    
  manual_intervention:
    description: "Direct manipulation of system state"
    instead: "Use administrative workflows"
    reasons:
      - Breaks audit trail
      - Increases error risk
      - Reduces transparency
      - Compromises compliance
    
  delayed_monitoring:
    description: "Reactive status checking"
    instead: "Proactive health monitoring"
    reasons:
      - Increases response time
      - Misses early warnings
      - Reduces prevention opportunities
      - Impacts service quality

  incomplete_documentation:
    description: "Partial action recording"
    instead: "Comprehensive audit logging"
    reasons:
      - Breaks compliance
      - Complicates troubleshooting
      - Reduces accountability
      - Hampers analysis
