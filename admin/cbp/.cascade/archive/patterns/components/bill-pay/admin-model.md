## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  fragmented_oversight:
    description: "Disconnected monitoring"
    instead: "Centralized administration"
    reasons:
      - Reduces visibility
      - Increases complexity
      - Hampers coordination
      - Compromises control
    
  reactive_management:
    description: "Response-based administration"
    instead: "Proactive oversight"
    reasons:
      - Delays resolution
      - Increases risks
      - Reduces efficiency
      - Impacts performance
    
  incomplete_tracking:
    description: "Partial system monitoring"
    instead: "Comprehensive oversight"
    reasons:
      - Missing context
      - Poor decisions
      - Reduced control
      - Compliance gaps
```
