# Account Management Security Model

## Core Principles
```yaml
purpose: "Security administration for account management"
key_aspects:
  - Access control administration
  - Security monitoring
  - Compliance management
  - Audit administration
```

## Access Control Administration
```yaml
admin_access:
  pattern: "Access Administration"
  implementation:
    management:
      - User administration
      - Role management
      - Permission sets
    
    monitoring:
      - Access tracking
      - Violation detection
      - Usage patterns
    
    maintenance:
      - Access updates
      - Role adjustments
      - Permission sync

role_management:
  pattern: "Role Administration"
  implementation:
    management:
      - Role definitions
      - Permission mapping
      - Access levels
    
    monitoring:
      - Role usage
      - Permission impact
      - Access patterns
    
    maintenance:
      - Role updates
      - Permission changes
      - Documentation
```

## Compliance Management
```yaml
compliance_control:
  pattern: "Compliance Administration"
  implementation:
    monitoring:
      - Policy compliance
      - Rule enforcement
      - Exception handling
    
    management:
      - Policy updates
      - Rule adjustments
      - Exception handling
    
    reporting:
      - Compliance reports
      - Violation summaries
      - Risk analysis

regulatory_management:
  pattern: "Regulatory Administration"
  implementation:
    monitoring:
      - Requirement tracking
      - Compliance status
      - Exception handling
    
    management:
      - Policy updates
      - Rule adjustments
      - Documentation
    
    reporting:
      - Status reports
      - Exception summaries
      - Risk analysis
```

## Audit Administration
```yaml
audit_control:
  pattern: "Audit Administration"
  implementation:
    configuration:
      - Audit rules
      - Logging policies
      - Retention settings
    
    monitoring:
      - Log collection
      - Event tracking
      - Pattern detection
    
    reporting:
      - Audit reports
      - Event analysis
      - Pattern summaries

log_management:
  pattern: "Log Administration"
  implementation:
    configuration:
      - Log settings
      - Retention rules
      - Archive policies
    
    monitoring:
      - Log collection
      - Event tracking
      - Space usage
    
    maintenance:
      - Log rotation
      - Archive management
      - Cleanup tasks
```

## Report Management
```yaml
security_reporting:
  pattern: "Security Reports"
  implementation:
    generation:
      - Security reports
      - Access summaries
      - Violation analysis
    
    distribution:
      - Report delivery
      - Access control
      - Archive management
    
    maintenance:
      - Template updates
      - Format control
      - History tracking

compliance_reporting:
  pattern: "Compliance Reports"
  implementation:
    generation:
      - Compliance reports
      - Audit summaries
      - Risk analysis
    
    distribution:
      - Report delivery
      - Access control
      - Archive management
    
    maintenance:
      - Template updates
      - Format control
      - History tracking
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  manual_security:
    why: "Inconsistent control"
    instead: "Automated management"
    
  direct_changes:
    why: "Security risk"
    instead: "Controlled updates"
    
  alert_flooding:
    why: "Alert fatigue"
    instead: "Smart thresholds"
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
approach:
  security_tests:
    - Access control
    - Alert handling
    - Report generation
    
  monitoring_tests:
    - Security tracking
    - Alert processing
    - Report validation
    
  compliance_tests:
    - Policy validation
    - Rule enforcement
    - Documentation
```

## Monitoring Guidelines
```yaml
observability:
  metrics:
    - Security health
    - Access stats
    - Violation rates
    
  logging:
    - Security events
    - Access attempts
    - Config changes
    
  alerting:
    - Security issues
    - Access violations
    - Policy breaches
```
