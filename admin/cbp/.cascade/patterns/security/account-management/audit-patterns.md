# Account Management Audit Patterns

## Core Principles
```yaml
purpose: "Comprehensive account activity audit"
key_aspects:
  - Transaction tracking
  - Balance monitoring
  - Access control
  - Compliance requirements
```

## Transaction Audit
```yaml
transaction_tracking:
  pattern: "Transaction Audit"
  events:
    initiation:
      - Request details
      - Account context
      - Amount data
      - Timestamp
    
    processing:
      - Status changes
      - System interactions
      - Error conditions
      - Retry attempts
    
    completion:
      - Final status
      - Processing time
      - Error resolution
      - Confirmation details

balance_tracking:
  pattern: "Balance Audit"
  events:
    changes:
      - Balance updates
      - Transaction links
      - Change reason
      - Timestamp
    
    verification:
      - Balance checks
      - Limit validation
      - Error detection
    
    reconciliation:
      - Balance matching
      - Discrepancy handling
      - Resolution tracking
```

## Access Audit
```yaml
access_tracking:
  pattern: "Access Audit"
  events:
    authentication:
      - Login attempts
      - Session management
      - Logout events
    
    authorization:
      - Permission checks
      - Access attempts
      - Resource usage
    
    violations:
      - Access denials
      - Policy breaches
      - Security alerts

operation_audit:
  pattern: "Operation Audit"
  events:
    execution:
      - Operation details
      - Account context
      - User context
    
    validation:
      - Permission checks
      - Limit validation
      - Rule enforcement
    
    completion:
      - Operation result
      - State changes
      - Error handling
```

## Compliance Audit
```yaml
regulatory_compliance:
  pattern: "Compliance Audit"
  implementation:
    tracking:
      - Policy compliance
      - Rule enforcement
      - Exception handling
    
    reporting:
      - Compliance status
      - Violation tracking
      - Report generation
    
    management:
      - Policy updates
      - Rule modifications
      - Exception handling

financial_compliance:
  pattern: "Financial Audit"
  implementation:
    monitoring:
      - Transaction patterns
      - Balance changes
      - Limit usage
    
    validation:
      - Regulatory rules
      - Policy compliance
      - Exception handling
    
    reporting:
      - Financial status
      - Risk assessment
      - Compliance reports
```

## State Audit
```yaml
state_tracking:
  pattern: "State Audit"
  implementation:
    monitoring:
      - State changes
      - Version control
      - History management
    
    validation:
      - State integrity
      - Rule compliance
      - Access control
    
    documentation:
      - State logging
      - Change tracking
      - Report creation

change_tracking:
  pattern: "Change Audit"
  implementation:
    detection:
      - Change capture
      - Impact analysis
      - Context preservation
    
    validation:
      - Change verification
      - Policy compliance
      - Rule enforcement
    
    documentation:
      - Change logging
      - History tracking
      - Report generation
```

## Performance Integration
```yaml
audit_optimization:
  pattern: "Efficient Auditing"
  implementation:
    capture:
      - Event batching
      - State compression
      - Resource pooling
    
    processing:
      - Async handling
      - Buffer management
      - Queue optimization
    
    storage:
      - Data compression
      - Index optimization
      - Cleanup rules

resource_management:
  pattern: "Resource Efficiency"
  implementation:
    allocation:
      - Buffer sizing
      - Connection pooling
      - Thread management
    
    optimization:
      - Write batching
      - Read caching
      - Index usage
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  selective_audit:
    why: "Incomplete tracking"
    instead: "Comprehensive audit"
    
  sync_logging:
    why: "Performance impact"
    instead: "Async processing"
    
  data_exposure:
    why: "Security risk"
    instead: "Protected audit"
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
approach:
  functionality:
    - Event capture
    - Data integrity
    - Report generation
    
  compliance:
    - Policy validation
    - Rule enforcement
    - Report accuracy
    
  performance:
    - Capture efficiency
    - Processing speed
    - Storage optimization
```

## Monitoring Guidelines
```yaml
observability:
  metrics:
    - Audit performance
    - Storage usage
    - Processing time
    
  logging:
    - System events
    - Access patterns
    - Change tracking
    
  alerting:
    - Policy violations
    - System issues
    - Resource problems
```
