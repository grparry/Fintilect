# Bill Pay Security Model

## Core Principles
```yaml
purpose: "Security administration for CBP Admin"
key_aspects:
  - Access control management
  - Security monitoring
  - Audit administration
  - Compliance monitoring
```

## Domain-Specific Permissions
```yaml
pattern:
  strategy: "Payment operation permissions"
  location: "src/components/bill-pay/settings/PermissionGroups.tsx"
  scope: "Bill Pay Operations"
  isolation: "Independent from organization-wide permissions"

implementation:
  components:
    - PermissionGroups
    - PaymentOperations
    - TransactionValidation
    - SecurityContext

  permissions:
    - Transaction approval limits
    - Payment method access
    - Validation rule management
    - Audit trail access
```

## Operation-Level Security
```yaml
transaction_security:
  pattern: "Transaction-level access control"
  implementation:
    validation:
      - Amount-based limits
      - Method-specific rules
      - Time-based constraints
      - Multi-party approval
    
    enforcement:
      - Real-time validation
      - Rule-based blocking
      - Approval workflows
      - Audit logging

payment_operations:
  pattern: "Operation-specific roles"
  implementation:
    roles:
      - Payment approver
      - Limit manager
      - Method administrator
      - Audit reviewer
    
    constraints:
      - Amount thresholds
      - Method restrictions
      - Time windows
      - Geographic limits
```

## System Boundaries
```yaml
isolation_rules:
  - No inheritance from organization permissions
  - Independent security context
  - Domain-specific validation rules
  - Separate audit trails

integration_points:
  authenticated_user:
    - Basic identity verification
    - Session management
    - Logout handling
    - Performance monitoring

  system_boundaries:
    - Clear domain separation
    - Independent role definitions
    - Separate management interfaces
    - Isolated state management
```

## Performance Monitoring
```yaml
measurements:
  operations:
    - Transaction validation time
    - Permission resolution speed
    - Rule evaluation performance
    - Audit logging latency
  
  boundaries:
    - Context switch overhead
    - Authentication verification
    - State isolation checks
    - Cross-boundary calls

implementation:
  - Use GlobalProfiler
  - Track operation timings
  - Monitor security boundaries
  - Log validation performance
```

## Future Considerations
```yaml
consolidation_preparation:
  current_state:
    - Maintain strict isolation
    - Document all boundaries
    - Track integration points
    - Preserve domain rules
  
  migration_readiness:
    - Clear interface definitions
    - Well-documented boundaries
    - Mapped security contexts
    - Identified dependencies
```

      - Role adjustments
      - Permission sync

role_management:
  pattern: "Role Administration"
  implementation:
    management:
      - Role definitions
      - Permission mapping
      - Access levels
    
    monitoring:
      - Role usage
      - Permission impact
      - Access patterns
    
    maintenance:
      - Role updates
      - Permission changes
      - Documentation
```

## Security Monitoring
```yaml

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  manual_security:

  direct_changes:
    why: "Security risk"
    instead: "Controlled updates"
    
  alert_flooding:
    why: "Alert fatigue"
    instead: "Smart thresholds"
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
approach:
  security_tests:
    - Access control
    - Alert handling
    - Report generation
    
  monitoring_tests:
    - Security tracking
    - Alert processing
    - Report validation
    
  compliance_tests:
    - Policy validation
    - Rule enforcement
    - Documentation
```
