## Administrative Guidelines
```yaml
management_principles:
  oversight:
    focus:
      - Exception patterns
      - Resolution efficiency
      - Resource utilization
      - Compliance status
    
    priorities:
      - Critical exceptions
      - Resource constraints
      - Performance issues
      - Compliance gaps
    
    escalation:
      - Alert thresholds
      - Response times
      - Impact severity
      - Resolution paths

  coordination:
    responsibilities:
      - Pattern monitoring
      - Resource oversight
      - Performance management
      - Compliance tracking
    
    communication:
      - Status updates
      - Resource alerts
      - Performance reports
      - Compliance notices
    
    documentation:
      - Pattern analysis
      - Resource logs
      - Performance metrics
      - Compliance records
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  manual_intervention:
    description: "Direct exception manipulation"
    instead: "Use administrative workflows"
    reasons:
      - Breaks audit trail
      - Bypasses controls
      - Compromises compliance
      - Reduces transparency
    
  resource_hoarding:
    description: "Excessive resource allocation"
    instead: "Dynamic resource management"
    reasons:
      - Reduces efficiency
      - Creates bottlenecks
      - Impacts performance
      - Wastes resources
    
  delayed_analysis:
    description: "Reactive pattern review"
    instead: "Proactive pattern monitoring"
    reasons:
      - Misses trends
      - Delays improvements
      - Increases risks
      - Reduces effectiveness
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
administrative_testing:
  oversight_validation:
    focus:

      - Resource management
      - Compliance verification
    
    scenarios:
      - Exception patterns
      - Resolution flows
      - Resource usage
      - Compliance events
    
    verification:
      - Pattern detection
      - Resolution efficiency
      - Resource optimization
      - Compliance status

  performance_validation:
    focus:
      - Resolution times
      - Resource utilization
      - Process efficiency
      - System capacity
    
    scenarios:
      - Load patterns
      - Resource constraints
      - Efficiency bottlenecks
      - Capacity limits
    
    verification:
