## Administrative Guidelines
```yaml
management_principles:
  oversight:
    focus:
      - Processing integrity
      - Error management
      - Compliance status
      - Performance health
    
    priorities:
      - Critical errors
      - Performance issues
      - Compliance gaps
      - Resource constraints
    
    escalation:
      - Alert thresholds
      - Response times
      - Impact severity
      - Resolution paths

  coordination:
    responsibilities:
      - Status monitoring
      - Error oversight
      - Compliance tracking
      - Performance management
    
    communication:
      - Status updates
      - Error alerts
      - Compliance notices
      - Performance reports
    
    documentation:
      - Status logs
      - Error records
      - Compliance reports
      - Performance metrics
```

## Anti-Patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  direct_intervention:
    description: "Manual process interference"
    instead: "Use administrative workflows"
    reasons:
      - Breaks audit trail
      - Bypasses controls
      - Compromises compliance
      - Reduces transparency
    
  delayed_monitoring:
    description: "Reactive oversight"
    instead: "Proactive monitoring"
    reasons:
      - Missed issues
      - Delayed response
      - Increased impact
      - Resource waste
    
  incomplete_tracking:
    description: "Partial monitoring"
    instead: "Comprehensive oversight"
    reasons:
      - Missing context
      - Incomplete analysis
      - Poor decisions
      - Compliance gaps
```
