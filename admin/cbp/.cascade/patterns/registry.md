# Pattern Registry
**Created**: 2025-01-02T16:29:44-07:00
**Status**: Active
**Purpose**: Central registry of all patterns

## Core Patterns
```yaml
phase_management:
  file: "core/phase-management.md"
  framework: "framework/phase-management.md"
  priority: 1
  status: "active"
  relationships:
    - "patterns/*"
    - "implementation/*"
    - "metrics/*"

testing:
  file: "core/testing.md"
  priority: 1
  status: "active"
  relationships:
    - "implementation/testing-*"
    - "metrics/tracker.jsonl"

security:
  file: "core/security.md"
  priority: 1
  status: "active"
  relationships:
    - "implementation/security-*"
```

## Implementation Patterns
```yaml
resource_wrapper:
  file: "implementation/resource-wrapper.md"
  status: "active"
  depends_on:
    - "core/testing.md"
    - "core/phase-management.md"
```

## Pattern Relationships
```yaml
dependencies:
  direct:
    - "phase_management -> testing"
    - "phase_management -> security"
    - "resource_wrapper -> testing"
  
  indirect:
    - "resource_wrapper -> phase_management"

validation:
  frequency: "continuous"
  focus:
    - "relationship_integrity"
    - "pattern_compliance"
```
