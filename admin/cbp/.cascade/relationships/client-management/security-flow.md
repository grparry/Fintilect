# Client Management Security Flow

## Security Relationships
```yaml
access_protection:
  relationship: "Access → Protection"
  patterns:
    - Permission flow
    - Data security
    - State management
  security:
    - Context preservation
    - Data protection
    - Audit logging

protection_privacy:
  relationship: "Protection → Privacy"
  patterns:
    - Data handling
    - Consent management
    - Usage control
  security:
    - Data filtering
    - Access control
    - Audit requirements

authentication_authorization:
  relationship: "Authentication → Authorization"
  patterns:
    - Identity flow
    - Permission resolution
    - Access control
  security:
    - Context binding
    - State protection
    - Audit tracking
```

## State Management
```yaml
security_state:
  pattern: "Security Context"
  implementation:
    tracking:
      - Context state
      - Permission state
      - Access state
    
    synchronization:
      - State alignment
      - Update propagation
      - Cleanup rules
    
    protection:
      - State encryption
      - Access control
      - History preservation

data_state:
  pattern: "Data Protection State"
  implementation:
    management:
      - Protection state
      - Access state
      - Usage state
    
    coordination:
      - State alignment
      - Update handling
      - History tracking
```

## Performance Integration
```yaml
optimization:
  security_flow:
    pattern: "Efficient Security"
    implementation:
      - Context caching
      - Permission resolution
      - State management
    
  protection_flow:
    pattern: "Efficient Protection"
    implementation:
      - Data handling
      - Access control
      - State tracking
```

## Testing Strategy
```yaml
integration_testing:
  flows:
    - Security pipeline
    - Protection chain
    - Privacy handling
  
  security:
    - Context preservation
    - Data protection
    - Access control
  
  performance:
    - Security overhead
    - Protection impact
    - State management
```
