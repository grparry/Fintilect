# Logging Pattern Relationships

## Pattern Connections

```cascade-rules
# Rule: Navigation Monitoring
WHEN using_navigation_pattern
THEN
  - MONITOR pattern_usage
  - TRACK effectiveness
  - IDENTIFY gaps
  - LOG appropriately
END

# Rule: Route Validation
WHEN using_routing_pattern
THEN
  - VALIDATE route_patterns
  - TRACK routing_issues
  - SUGGEST improvements
  - UPDATE gaps IF needed
END
```

## Validation Rules

```cascade-rules
# Rule: Log Management
WHEN managing_logs
THEN
  - ROTATE when_needed
  - MONITOR performance
  - ANALYZE gaps
  - MAINTAIN efficiency
END

# Rule: Pattern Evolution
WHEN pattern_ineffective
THEN
  - ANALYZE root_cause
  - SUGGEST improvements
  - UPDATE documentation
  - TRACK changes
END
```

## Implementation Notes
- Logging should enhance pattern effectiveness without adding significant overhead
- Pattern relationships help identify systemic issues
- Validation ensures logging remains efficient and useful
