# Component Relationships

## Core Patterns
```yaml
hierarchy:
  administrative:
    type: "Administrative Components"
    responsibility: "System oversight and management"
    location: "src/components/admin"
  
  layout:
    type: "Container Components"
    responsibility: "Page structure and routing"
    location: "src/components/layout"
  
  feature:
    type: "Feature Components"
    responsibility: "Business logic and state management"
    location: "src/components/{feature}"
  
  common:
    type: "Shared Components"
    responsibility: "Reusable UI elements"
    location: "src/components/common"

dependencies:
  direction: "Top-down"
  rules:
    - Administrative components oversee all other components
    - Layout components can import feature components
    - Feature components can import common components
    - Common components should be self-contained
    - No circular dependencies
```

## Administrative Relationships
```yaml
oversight:
  bill_pay:
    external:
      - Integration monitoring
      - Performance tracking
      - Compliance verification
    internal:
      - Component monitoring
      - Service tracking
      - Resource management
  
  account_management:
    external:
      - Integration monitoring
      - Performance tracking
      - Compliance verification
    internal:
      - Component monitoring
      - Service tracking
      - Resource management
  
  client_management:
    external:
      - Integration monitoring
      - Performance tracking
      - Compliance verification
    internal:
      - Component monitoring
      - Service tracking
      - Resource management

coordination:
  cross_component:
    - Pattern alignment
    - Resource coordination
    - Compliance management
  
  responsibilities:
    - Integration oversight
    - Service management
    - Resource allocation
    - Compliance tracking
```

## Key Relationships
```yaml
bill_pay:
  components:
    - name: "BillPayAdmin"
      type: "Administrative"
      dependencies:
        - "IntegrationMonitor"
        - "PerformanceTracker"
        - "ComplianceManager"
      state: "BillPayAdminContext"
    
    - name: "BillPayDashboard"
      type: "Container"
      dependencies:
        - "PaymentList"
        - "PaymentForm"
        - "AuditLog"
      state: "BillPayContext"
    
    - name: "PaymentList"
      type: "Feature"
      dependencies:
        - "DataTable"
        - "StatusBadge"
      services:
        - "bill-pay.service"
        - "admin.service"

    - name: "PaymentForm"
      type: "Feature"
      dependencies:
        - "Form"
        - "ValidationMessage"
      services:
        - "bill-pay.service"
        - "validation.service"
        - "admin.service"

account_management:
  components:
    - name: "AccountAdmin"
      type: "Administrative"
      dependencies:
        - "IntegrationMonitor"
        - "PerformanceTracker"
        - "ComplianceManager"
      state: "AccountAdminContext"
    
    - name: "AccountDashboard"
      type: "Container"
      dependencies:
        - "AccountList"
        - "AccountDetails"
        - "AuditLog"
      state: "AccountContext"

client_management:
  components:
    - name: "ClientAdmin"
      type: "Administrative"
      dependencies:
        - "IntegrationMonitor"
        - "PerformanceTracker"
        - "ComplianceManager"
      state: "ClientAdminContext"
    
    - name: "ClientDashboard"
      type: "Container"
      dependencies:
        - "ClientList"
        - "ClientDetails"
        - "AuditLog"
      state: "ClientContext"

security:
  components:
    - name: "SecurityAdmin"
      type: "Administrative"
      dependencies:
        - "ComplianceManager"
        - "AccessControl"
        - "AuditManager"
      state: "SecurityAdminContext"
    
    - name: "SecuritySettings"
      type: "Container"
      dependencies:
        - "PermissionGroups"
        - "RoleManager"
      state: "SecurityContext"
```

## Anti-patterns
```yaml
avoid:
  component_structure:
    - Importing container components into features
    - Direct service calls in common components
    - Cross-feature component dependencies
    - Deep component nesting (max 3 levels)
  
  administrative:
    - Bypassing administrative oversight
    - Direct integration management
    - Isolated compliance handling
    - Fragmented monitoring
```
