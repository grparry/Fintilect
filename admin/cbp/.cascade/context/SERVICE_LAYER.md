# Service Layer Architecture

## Service Categories and Responsibilities
1. **Core Services**
   - Authentication: User session and token management
   - Client Management: Credit union client operations
   - User Management: User CRUD and permissions
   - Security: Access control and audit logging

2. **Business Services**
   - Bill Pay: Payment scheduling and processing
   - Payment Processing: Transaction handling and reconciliation
   - Exception Handling: FIS exceptions and resolution workflows
   - Reporting: Financial and operational reporting

3. **Support Services**
   - Notifications: Template-based communication
   - Holiday Management: Banking holiday schedules
   - Dashboard: Operational metrics and monitoring
   - Permissions: Role-based access control

## Mock Data Requirements
- Client data must reflect credit union hierarchy
- Payment data must maintain transaction integrity
- Exception data must cover all FIS error codes
- User data must align with permission models
- Holiday data must follow federal banking guidelines

## Service Dependencies
- Authentication -> Client Management
- Client Management -> User Management
- Bill Pay -> Payment Processing
- Exception Handling -> Bill Pay
- Reporting -> All Services

## Critical Paths
1. Payment Processing Flow:
   - Authentication
   - Client Validation
   - Payment Validation
   - Processing
   - Exception Handling
   - Notification

2. User Management Flow:
   - Authentication
   - Client Context
   - Permission Validation
   - User Operations
   - Audit Logging

## Performance Requirements
- Authentication: < 200ms
- Payment Processing: < 500ms
- Report Generation: < 2s
- Mock Data Generation: < 100ms
